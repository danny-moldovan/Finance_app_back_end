This plant is located on the site of the aluminum flat rolling mill currently under construction for Aluminum Dynamics LLC (ADL) in Columbus, Mississippi, USA. The flat rolling mill specializes in the production of sheet metal, among other things for the automotive industry, and makes it possible to focus specifically on sustainable lightweight solutions and aluminum products that are becoming increasingly important for the energy and automotive sectors. D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, March 12, 2025 \u2013 Despite the persistently demanding economic environment, Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co generated robust operating income (EBITDA) of \u20ac136 million before material special effects in fiscal year 2024 (2023: \u20ac190 million). At Group level, shipments increased slightly year on year to 4.5 million tons (2023: 4.2 million tons). Sales dropped slightly year on year and amounted to \u20ac6.6 billion (2023: \u20ac7.0 billion). This was attributable to the decline in steel prices in the USA and Europe. The consolidated income from continuing operations amounted to \u20ac-146 million in the fiscal year 2024, while the consolidated income from discontinued operations of the European steel distribution business, which was sold in March 2024, amounted to \u20ac-30\u00a0million. Accordingly, earnings per share including discontinued operations amounted to \u20ac-1.77. Through consistent net working capital management, the Company generated a significantly positive cash flow from operating activities of \u20ac160\u00a0million (2023: \u20ac287 million) for the third time in a row. Against this backdrop and the fact that only part of the net income generated in previous years was distributed, a dividend of \u20ac0.20 per share will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. Kl\u00f6ckner & Co will therefore likely pay a dividend for the fourth year in succession. The equity ratio was a very solid 48.6% at year-end 2024 and thus above the prior-year level (December 31, 2023: 45.4%). Contact Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co\u00a0SE: Guido Kerkhoff, CEO of Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co\u00a0SE: \u201cWe have made important progress in implementing our Group strategy and continue to focus on expanding higher-value-added business. This includes, for example, the construction of a new aluminum processing facility in the USA. This will make us less dependent on volatile metal prices and generate new growth opportunities.\u201d Commodities Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co continued to consistently implement its Group strategy in the past fiscal year and made remarkable progress. A pivotal component of the strategy is the focus on higher value-added business in order to further reduce earnings volatility and increase profitability. In fiscal year 2024, the Company significantly concentrated its focus on the higher-value processing and metalworking business in the core markets of North America and the lucrative DACH region in Europe (Germany, Austria and Switzerland). Through targeted investments at selected sites in the USA and Germany, distribution centers were transformed into production and processing hubs for higher-value metal solutions. This move ensures considerably more independence from volatile steel price trends and opens up new opportunities for further growth. In 2024, the Group already generated over 80% of its sales with the steel service center and higher value-added business and thus outside the traditional steel distribution. This enabled Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co to continue its successful transformation into a metal processor. Additionally, due to the significant progress made, the Company has raised its near-term reduction target for Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 2030 from 50% to 62.5% to emphasize its commitment to the 1.5 degree target. In January 2025, Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co\u2019s updated climate targets were confirmed by the SBTi. ISIN: DE000KC01000; WKN: KC0100; Common Code: 025808576. Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co\u00a0SE is one of the largest producer-independent processors of steel and metal products and one of the world\u2019s leading steel service center companies. With its distribution and service network of around 120\u00a0sites, primarily in North America and the \u201cDACH\u201d region (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), Kl\u00f6ckner & Co supplies more than 60,000\u00a0customers. Currently, the Group has around 6,500 employees. Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co had sales of some \u20ac6.6 billion in fiscal year 2024. With the expansion of its portfolio of CO2-reduced materials, services and logistics options under the Nexigen\u00ae umbrella brand, the Company is underscoring its role as a pioneer of a sustainable steel industry. At the same time, Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co leads the way in the steel industry\u2019s digital transformation and has set itself the target of digitalizing and largely automating its supply and service chain. In this way, the Company aims to develop into the leading one-stop shop for steel and metal products as well as higher value-added processing in North America and Europe. Currencies Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co has once again been recognized with the German Sustainability Award for these efforts. The award proves that Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co has successfully integrated sustainability into its business model and is thus making an effective, long-term contribution to the transformation of the industry. For the current fiscal year, Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co expects demand to increase in the relevant sales markets in Europe and North America. Accordingly, the Company is forecasting a considerable increase in sales and turnover compared to the previous year. Based on this trend and the Company\u2019s considerably improved operational positioning, as well as the assumption that the significant negative price effects that occurred in 2024 will not be repeated, Kl\u00f6ckner\u00a0&\u00a0Co expects a considerable year-on-year increase in EBITDA before material special effects. For the first quarter 2025, EBITDA before material special effects is expected to be around the level of previous year\u2019s quarter (Q1 2024: \u20ac42m). The Company is also forecasting a significant year-on-year increase in cash flow from operating activities for the full year.

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has straightforward and understandable regulations, so companies can conduct business under secure regulatory systems. Growth is enabled by this, keeping the companies in check and in line. India can draw lessons from such a model of regulation that is protective of consumers and friendly to innovation. Having effective frameworks for settling disputes, sufficient security arrangements for exchanges, and disclosure norms would contribute significantly to building the confidence of investors. A regulatory system should not be too restrictive nor entirely lacking in control. The balance has been achieved in Switzerland and Singapore in creating licensing systems to enable legitimate crypto businesses to thrive while there is financial security. In Pictures: UK Cargo Ship Collides With US Tanker In North Sea Similarly, the United States treats cryptocurrencies as property and taxes them on capital gains like stocks. Comprehensive reporting regulations, however, make it convenient for investors to cope with taxation. India might possibly fare better with a well-defined, systematic taxation plan that encourages investment and does not deter individuals from participating. Singapore, by means of its Payment Services Act, requires crypto businesses to obtain licensing under the jurisdiction of stringent AML and anti-terrorism financing regulations. Such regulation has attracted significant players in the blockchain industry into the nation, making Singapore a global fintech leader. One of the areas India can do better in its crypto regulations is taxation. The 30% tax on crypto profits and 1% TDS on trades have already led to declining volumes and rising uncertainty. Germany has adopted a more favorable approach. Long-term crypto holdings over one year are exempt from capital gains tax in Germany, which encourages good investment rather than speculation. In contrast, China has adopted a restrictive approach by banning crypto trading and mining. This has avoided some of the dangers but also compelled crypto businesses to move to friendlier jurisdictions.

The company expects sales in local currencies to decline in the first half, with a softer first quarter and a sequential improvement in the second quarter. A more positive outlook for the second half is supported by a strong reception of newly launched products and partnerships in both divisions, along with additional launches in 2025. Adjusted net profit2 was CHF 103.1 million, down from CHF 164.4 million in 2023, when earnings were significantly boosted by a one-time positive effect related to transitional measures from the Swiss tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were CHF 8.08, compared to CHF 12.88 in 2023. The lower demand for life science instrumentation also had a negative impact on the Partnering Business, influencing both the Cavro\u00ae OEM components business and the contract development and manufacturing revenues for life science instruments in the Paramit product line. Market weakness in China also impacted the Cavro OEM components business and sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence product line to larger global OEM customers with significant exposure to China. However, outside China, sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence product line developed positively, with increased contributions from newly launched systems. Sales in the Paramit product line, which served medical market customers, were negatively affected by normalized demand patterns following the replenishment of depleted inventories in 2023, when supply chain disruptions eased, and by the anticipated reduction in sales from the pure pass-through of material costs. These impacts were specific to a single customer and included a model transition, rather than being related to end market conditions. All these factors had a more pronounced impact in the second half of the year, when segment sales decreased by 15.9% in local currencies.Order entry in the Partnering Business for the full year decreased slightly more than sales as OEM customers adjusted their ordering patterns, shifting from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Despite this shift, the book-to-bill ratio remained close to 1. Cash flow from operating activities was CHF 148.5 million, compared to CHF 160.6 million in 2023. Cash conversion improved to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%). Thanks to solid cash flow management, Tecan's net liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term time deposits, less bank liabilities, loans, and the outstanding bond) increased to CHF 153.7 million as of December 31, 2024, up from CHF 112.6 million on December 31, 2023. 1 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 16.4 million) New launches and rich project pipeline in Partnering BusinessAt the 2024 Capital Markets Day, Tecan highlighted its strong Partnering Business relationships and robust project pipeline across its three business lines: Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit. Examples include Tecan's collaboration with Illumina in the Synergence line, supporting their expansion into multi-omics with the development of a new system. Through Paramit, Tecan assisted THINK\u00ae Surgical with the design transfer and initiated the manufacturing of their TMINI\u00ae miniature robotic system, cart, and smart cell charging station. Additionally, Paramit is manufacturing the Avive Connect AED, an innovative and user-friendly automated external defibrillator aimed at improving survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest. 3 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Life Sciences Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 6.4 million). The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Partnering Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 5.3 million). For further information: Highlights 2024 Information by business segment Tecan also expanded its digital ecosystem with the new Introspect analytics platform, enhancing operational insights and service efficiency. This digital expansion benefits customers across both business segments. Proposal for a stable dividend at the Annual General Meeting In 2024, Tecan advanced its product portfolio with significant launches in genomics, proteomics, and cell biology. Examples include the Resolvex i300 module, introduced in February, which enhances throughput in proteomics by integrating with the Fluent\u00ae platform, and the Spark Cyto 3D, which supports drug discovery by enabling the analysis of complex 3D cell models. During a Capital Markets Day in October 2024, Tecan previewed Veya, a multi-omics liquid handling workstation that simplifies lab automation and boosts productivity. Officially launched at the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (SLAS) international conference in San Diego, USA, in January 2025, Veya provides effortless automation by overcoming key barriers in lab automation. Tecan will hold an analyst and media conference to discuss the 2024 annual results today at 09:00under Investor Relations. A link to the webcast will be provided immediately prior to the event. Attachment Enhancing operational resilience through cost-reduction initiatives, while expanding global operations and commercial reachIn 2024, Tecan enhanced its operational resilience by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and continuing to optimize its global organizational footprint. Following the successful transfer of Cavro component production to facilities in Morgan Hill, California, and Penang, Malaysia, and the closure of the San Jose site in 2023, Tecan relocated its genomic reagents site from Redwood City to the expanding Morgan Hill hub at the end of 2024. In Penang, Tecan successfully passed an extensive FDA inspection, laying a strong foundation for future production of medical devices, including class 3 devices. The first medical device production was successfully transitioned to Penang in 2024. Alongside site consolidation, Tecan focused on supply chain optimization and increased vertical integration of manufacturing to leverage the Group's full capabilities and realize cost synergies.On the commercial front, Tecan established a direct sales office in South Korea in 2024 by acquiring a long-standing distributor in the region. This new entity includes team members with over 20 years of experience working with Tecan, bringing valuable local market knowledge to better serve this growing market. The dial-in numbers for the conference call are as follows:For participants from Europe: +41 (0)58 310 50 00 or +44 (0)207 107 0613 (UK)For participants from the US: +1 (1) 631 570 5613 Based on the solid cash flows for the full year 2024 and on the basis of an ongoing positive business outlook, the Board of Directors will propose at the Company's Annual General Meeting on April 18, 2024, an unchanged dividend of CHF 3.00 per share. Half of the dividend, i.e., CHF 1.50, will again be paid out from the available capital contribution reserve and is therefore not subject to withholding tax. Adjusted EBITDA1 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) was CHF 164.4 million, down from CHF 220.6 million in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 17.6% of sales (2023: 20.5%), aligning with the revised margin outlook of 16-18%. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, as profitability is highly volume-dependent. However, profitability was supported by a comprehensive cost-reduction program. Additionally, exchange rate movements in major currencies against the Swiss franc negatively impacted the margin by approximately 40 basis points. Tecan CEO Dr. Achim von Leoprechting commented: \u00abTecan is navigating a challenging market environment marked by reduced spending in our target markets, leading to lower demand in both the Life Sciences and Partnering Business segments. These challenges have been compounded by general market weakness in China and specific customer-related factors. In response, we have implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program and optimized our global operations to reinforce our leading position. The long-term trends in healthcare remain unchanged: from life science research to clinical applications, automation and innovation are crucial for scaling healthcare solutions in research, clinical diagnostics, and medtech. This is especially important amid rising healthcare costs, ultimately benefiting people worldwide. With our dedicated team, we are driving exciting innovations and look forward to launching promising new products across both businesses, positioning us well to capitalize on market recovery as conditions improve.\u00bb Financial results full-year and second half of 2024 Tecan GroupMartin Br\u00e4ndleSenior Vice President, Corporate Communications & IRTel. +41 (0) 44 922 84 30Fax +41 (0) 44 922 88 89investor@tecan.comwww.tecan.com Tecan reports 2024 financial results, enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions In 2024, reduced spending in the biopharmaceutical industry led to decreased demand for life science research instruments, affecting both the Life Sciences Business and the Partnering Business. Additionally, a general market weakness in China impacted both direct sales and indirect business through global OEM customers. In the Partnering Business, sales were further influenced by specific customer-related factors, including normalized demand patterns following inventory replenishment by a key customer in 2023. As a result, reported sales for the Group in fiscal year 2024 decreased by 13.0% in Swiss francs, totaling CHF 934.3 million (2023: CHF 1,074.4 million). In local currencies, sales were 11.5% below the prior-year period, aligning with the revised sales outlook from October 2024, which anticipated a decline of 12-14%. Sales in the second half decreased by 12.3% in Swiss francs and by 11.3% in local currencies compared to the prior-year period. These sales results were previously communicated in a trading statement on January 8, 2025. Partnering Business (OEM business)The Partnering Business generated sales of CHF 537.3 million in 2024 (2023: CHF 622.6 million or CHF 613.1 million in local currencies), marking a decrease of 13.7% in Swiss francs and 12.4% in local currencies. As anticipated, Tecan did not record any meaningful sales from the pass-through of material costs in this segment for 2024, compared to CHF 8.0 million in 2023. Innovation and product launches in the Life Sciences Business About TecanTecan (www.tecan.com) improves people's lives and health by empowering customers to scale healthcare innovation globally from life science to the clinic. Tecan is a pioneer and global leader in laboratory automation. As an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Tecan is also a leader in developing and manufacturing OEM instruments, components and medical devices that are then distributed by partner companies. Founded in Switzerland in 1980, the company has 3,300 employees, with manufacturing, research and development sites in Europe, North America and Asia, and maintains a sales and service network in over 70 countries. In 2024, Tecan generated sales of CHF 934 million (USD 1,062 million; EUR 984 million). Registered shares of Tecan Group are traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange (TECN; ISIN CH0012100191). Full-year order entry was CHF 903.6 million, a decrease of 12.1% compared to CHF 1,028.1 million in 2023, reflecting a 10.5% decline in local currencies. The Partnering Business segment was impacted by a shift in OEM customer ordering patterns, moving from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Meanwhile, the Life Sciences Business segment saw moderate order entry growth in local currencies in the second half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, the Group's order entry in the second half decreased by 11.2% in local currencies. Participants should, if possible, dial in 15 minutes before the start of the event. Reported EBIT amounted to CHF 46.6 million (2023: CHF 64.4 million), while the reported operating profit margin reached 8.7% of sales (2023: 10.3%). Similar to the Life Sciences Business segment, lower sales volumes and the resulting negative economies of scale were the main factors affecting margin development. The adjusted EBITDA3 for this segment was CHF 91.1 million, compared to CHF 125.6 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.9% of sales, compared to 20.1% in 2023. The overall market environment is showing first signs of stabilization after a significant decline in demand last year, with further improvements expected over the course of 2025. However, new political uncertainties have emerged, including the announced reductions to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research budget in the US, which could further impact demand for life science research instruments. For 2025, Tecan anticipates that the year will begin with continued softer market conditions, with potential improvement as the year progresses. Depending on the extent of this improvement in the second half, the market could turn slightly positive for the full year, driven by specific growth segments, such as the clinical diagnostics market. M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland, March 12, 2025 - The Tecan Group (SIX Swiss Exchange: TECN) today announced its full set of audited financial results for 2024, underscoring its commitment to enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions. The company also initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025. Outlook Financial results for the full year 2024 - Highlights Reported EBIT in this segment (earnings before interest and taxes) reached CHF 39.5 million (2023: CHF 84.4 million). The reported operating profit margin decreased to 9.8% of sales (2023: 18.3%), primarily due to the negative volume effect, which resulted in missing economies of scale. Cost control measures helped alleviate the impact of lower sales volumes and adverse exchange rate effects. The adjusted EBITDA3 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) for this segment was CHF 79.1 million, compared to CHF 105.5 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.6% of sales, compared to 22.9% in 2023. Key upcoming dates Life Sciences Business (end-customer business)Sales in the Life Sciences Business in 2024 reached CHF 397.0 million (2023: CHF 451.8 million or CHF 442.1 million in local currencies), reflecting a decrease of 12.1% in Swiss francs and 10.2% in local currencies. Reduced CAPEX spending by the biopharmaceutical industry globally, along with government and academic customers in the US, resulted in decreased demand for life science research instruments. Additionally, market weakness in China negatively impacted demand, as the announced stimulus program failed to provide any impetus in 2024. Instead, it prompted some customers to delay orders while awaiting funding decisions. Contributing to a more favorable sales development in the Life Sciences Business were recovering consumables sales post-pandemic, a solid service business due to a higher installed base of instruments, and continued strong demand for newly launched products, particularly from genomic diagnostics companies. Recurring sales of services, consumables and reagents increased to 57.6% of segment sales (2023: 52.8%).In the second half of the year, sales declined by 5.0% in local currencies, following the sharp 15.5% decline in the first half. Sequentially, the Life Sciences Business segment grew by 13.6% in local currencies when comparing the second half of 2024 to the first half.In the second half of 2024, the Life Sciences Business segment experienced moderate order entry growth in local currencies compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio slightly above 1 for the full year. The pipeline of new development projects has been further enriched through joint selling of Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit services, targeting key customers in the life sciences, lab diagnostics, and Medtech segments. Tecan aims to double new project signings by 2027 through joint selling efforts, a targeted approach, and strategic account management. The outlook 2025 does not take account of potential acquisitions during the course of the year. The expectations regarding profitability are based on an average exchange rate forecast for full year 2025 of one euro equaling CHF 0.95 and one US dollar equaling CHF 0.90. Tecan also reiterated its mid-term outlook, in which the company anticipates returning to average organic growth rates in the mid to high single-digit percentage range in local currencies under normal market conditions, while continuously improving profitability. In 2024, Tecan demonstrated its commitment to agile cost management amid evolving economic conditions and revenue trends by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and optimizing its global organizational footprint. These efforts are designed to protect profitability without limiting the company's growth potential. As a result, Tecan forecasts an adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding restructuring, acquisition- and integration-related costs, of 17.5-18.5% of sales. 2 The calculation of 2024 adjusted net profit and adjusted earnings per share excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 16.4 million) and accumulated amortization of acquired intangible assets (+CHF 19.0 million) and they were calculated with the reported Group tax rate of 13.6%. Further building on sustainability activitiesTecan's 2024 Sustainability Report, published as part of the Annual Report, includes a Climate Risk Scenarios Analysis, highlighting the company's proactive approach to addressing transition and physical risks related to climate change. In preparation for the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Tecan has integrated related data management into its Finance function. For the first time, Tecan's financial auditors conducted a limited assurance audit of key 2024 environmental and social data points. Further progress was made towards greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, with renewable sources accounting for 87% of all electricity purchased. In 2025, Tecan will continue its pragmatic approach to managing risks and opportunities associated with the company's material topics.

On Wednesday, March 12, the Nifty IT index entered bear market territory, having corrected more than 20 per cent from its all-time high in December last year. All stocks within the Nifty IT index are currently in the red, with names like LTIMindtree and Mphasis seeing corrections of over 30% since December 13, 2024. ICRA expects attrition levels to stabilise at a long-term average of 12-13 per cent over the near term. Moreover, employee cost as a percentage of operating income (OI) declined marginally to 56.2 per cent in Q3 FY2025 from 57 per cent in Q3 FY2024 owing to moderation in wage hikes in the current fiscal. This, coupled with increased employee utilisation and optimisation of cost structure supported the OPM for the sample set at 22.5-23 per cent in recent quarters, which are expected to sustain over FY2026. The last 12 months\u2019 (LTM) attrition for the IT companies corrected sharply to 12.8 per cent in Q3 FY2025 from 22.3 per cent in Q3 FY2023 as the overall slowdown in growth momentum and strong hiring in the previous fiscal addressed the demand-supply mismatch witnessed earlier. The ratings agency projects its sample set of 15 large and small Indian IT services companies (which account for nearly 60 per cent of the industry in revenue terms) to witness a moderate 4-6 per cent revenue expansion in USD terms in FY2026. While near-term revenue pressures exist and deal cycles have elongated further, overall deal wins for the industry in recent quarters have remained resilient. Industry participants continue to sit on healthy total contract value, which provides revenue visibility over the near to medium term. \u2018Easing Of Attrition Rates\u2019 Deepak Jotwani, vice-president and sector head, ICRA, said, \u201cThe growth momentum for ICRA\u2019s sample set of IT services companies is likely to remain muted over the near term, owing to the looming uncertainty related to imposition of the US trade tariffs and macroeconomic headwinds across the key markets of the US and Europe.\" Swipe Left For Next Video ICRA anticipates attrition levels to stabilise around the long-term average of 12-13 per cent over the near term. Moreover, hiring is likely to remain low until the growth momentum picks up by the end of FY2026. The operating profit margins (OPM) for the sample set is expected to sustain at 22.5-23.0 per cent over next three to four quarters. Latest Blogs ICRA expects hiring to remain low in the near term until the growth momentum picks up by the end of FY2026. Lower hiring activity can also be correlated with higher investments by the industry on GenAI and the expected benefits in terms of increased productivity and cost savings. Leading Indian IT services companies have trained a sizable portion of their employee base in GenAI skills and have already started ramping up their capabilities and service offerings, to deliver GenAI-based solutions to their clients. ICRA projects a moderate 4-6% revenue expansion in USD terms in FY2026, following the 4-5% increase estimated for FY2025. Policy changes by the US government for key sectors catered to by Indian IT services companies as well as future interest rate trajectory will remain the key monitorables, he added. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley also sounded cautious on the earnings outlook for the Indian IT sector. \u201cWe lower our revenue growth forecasts for the sector as a whole for FY27. Our earnings per share (EPS) estimates don\u2019t change much as we factor in rupee depreciation versus the US dollar. However, we lower our target multiples for stocks as we see risk of stocks reverting closer to their long-term average multiples in the absence of any material positive catalyst,\" wrote Gaurav Rateria, Sulabh Govila and Sakshi Rana of Morgan Stanley in a note. The ICRA sample set recorded a YoY revenue growth of 3.6% in USD terms in 9M FY2025, witnessing gradual recovery over the past three quarters, supported by a relatively lower base of FY2024, slight uptick in discretionary spend by customers in the banking, financial services & insurance (BFSI) and retail sectors in some markets and investments in Generative AI (GenAI) initiatives translating into new order inflows. \u201cThis has started to show results as the inflow of GenAI-related deals for major industry players have risen in recent quarters and is expected to pick up materially over the medium term, as overall technology adoption is more pervasive. The healthcare and BFSI sectors remain the early adopters of AI/GenAI capabilities and continue to invest in the same,\" Jotwani added. Large and medium Indian IT companies include TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, Coforge, and Persistent, among others. TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro: Even as the IT shares are under stress amid profit-booking and fears of recessions in the US, ratings agency ICRA said the tech industry is likely to remain muted over the near term, owing to the looming uncertainty related to the imposition of the US trade tariffs and macroeconomic headwinds across the key markets of the US and Europe. It added that the IT industry is expected to witness a moderate 4-6 per cent revenue expansion in dollar terms in FY2026.

Market participants remain focused on the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (RBA) policy outlook, especially after last week\u2019s strong economic data reduced expectations of further rate cuts. Economic growth surpassed forecasts, marking its first acceleration in over a year. With the Federal Reserve in its blackout period ahead of the March 19 meeting, central bank commentary will be scarce this week. The US Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of maintaining price stability and maximum employment. According to such mandate, inflation should be at around 2% YoY and has become the weakest pillar of the central bank\u2019s directive ever since the world suffered a pandemic, which extends to these days. Price pressures keep rising amid supply-chain issues and bottlenecks, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) hanging at multi-decade highs. The Fed has already taken measures to tame inflation and is expected to maintain an aggressive stance in the foreseeable future. Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite.

A record-breaking launch may encourage investors to allocate more resources to game development companies, fostering innovation and potentially leading to more groundbreaking titles. Additionally, the game's performance could impact stock markets, particularly shares of Take-Two Interactive and associated companies, reflecting investor confidence in the gaming sector's profitability. The launch of Grand Theft Auto VI is poised to have a multifaceted economic impact, driving substantial revenue, creating jobs, and influencing various sectors beyond gaming. While challenges exist, the anticipation surrounding the game's release underscores the significant role that major video game titles play in the global economy. As the industry continues to evolve, the success of GTA 6 may serve as a bellwether for future trends in entertainment, technology, and consumer engagement. GTA 6's anticipated global reach means its economic impact will not be confined to a single region. International markets, including Europe, Asia, and Latin America, are expected to contribute significantly to sales figures. This worldwide engagement can lead to cross-cultural exchanges, influence global entertainment trends, and open up new markets for related products and services. Moreover, the game's cultural impact can inspire other creative works, from music and fashion to literature and art, further extending its economic footprint. The development, marketing, and distribution of a major title like GTA 6 necessitate a considerable workforce, encompassing game designers, programmers, artists, marketers, and support staff. This demand contributes to job creation both directly within Rockstar Games and indirectly through associated industries such as merchandising, advertising, and retail. Furthermore, the game's release is expected to invigorate the gaming industry, attracting new players and encouraging increased engagement from existing gamers. This heightened interest can lead to a surge in console and accessory sales, benefiting hardware manufacturers and retailers alike. Beyond the immediate gaming sphere, the release of GTA 6 is likely to influence various ancillary markets. The entertainment industry, for instance, may experience a ripple effect, with potential adaptations into films or series, merchandise sales, and promotional partnerships. Additionally, the increased demand for high-quality graphics and immersive gameplay can drive advancements in technology sectors, including graphics processing units (GPUs), virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) technologies. These technological advancements can have broader applications beyond gaming, contributing to innovation in fields such as simulation training, education, and virtual meetings. Analysts anticipate that GTA 6 will break multiple records upon its release. Projections suggest that the game could generate approximately $3.2 billion in its first year, with over $1 billion accrued from pre-orders alone.\u00a0 This level of revenue not only underscores the game's popularity but also highlights its potential to boost the financial performance of its publisher, Take-Two Interactive. Such a significant influx of capital can lead to increased investments in future projects, expansion of development teams, and enhanced marketing strategies, thereby stimulating economic activity within the gaming sector. The forthcoming release of Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6) is poised to make a significant economic impact, not only within the gaming industry but also across various sectors of the global economy. Developed by Rockstar Games and published by Take-Two Interactive, GTA 6 is one of the most highly anticipated video game titles in recent history. Its launch is expected to generate substantial revenue, create employment opportunities, and influence technological advancements. The launch of a blockbuster game like GTA 6 can stimulate consumer spending, not only on the game itself but also on related products and services. This includes the purchase of gaming consoles, peripherals, internet services, and in-game microtransactions. The economic multiplier effect suggests that this initial spending can lead to further economic activity, as businesses reinvest earnings into wages, expansion, and other expenditures, thereby amplifying the overall economic impact. \u00a9 Analytics Insight 2025 Follow Us While the economic prospects of GTA 6 launch are promising, several challenges warrant consideration. The gaming industry has faced recent downturns, including significant layoffs and decreased consumer engagement post-pandemic.\u00a0 Additionally, the rumored price point of $100 has elicited mixed reactions from consumers, with some expressing reluctance to pay the premium price.\u00a0 Balancing pricing strategies to ensure profitability while maintaining consumer satisfaction will be crucial. Furthermore, the industry's competitive nature means that other high-profile releases around the same time could impact sales and market share.", "https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/india-s-major-prop-firms-for-2025-rated-by-propfirms-12961638.html": "The best prop firms for Indian traders offer low-cost challenges, high profit splits, fast payouts, and access to key markets like USD/INR and FTSE 100 Index.

Backed by OANDA, a globally regulated forex and CFD broker, it provides raw spreads from 0.0 pips, a commission-based pricing model, and a trailing or static drawdown system depending on the challenge type. Evaluation ProcessDNA Funded provides three challenge types, each catering to different trading strategies and experience levels:Single Helix Challenge \u2013 A one-step challenge with moderate profit targets and no time limits, ideal for traders who prefer a relaxed evaluation process.Double Helix Challenge \u2013 A two-step challenge designed for disciplined traders, with structured profit targets and standard risk parameters.Pro Challenge \u2013 A time-restricted challenge suited for high-frequency traders, featuring a lower profit target but stricter drawdown rules.All challenges offer add-ons for faster payouts and increased profit splits, allowing traders to customise their evaluation experience.Funded Accounts & Profit SplitsAfter passing the evaluation, you can access funded accounts ranging from $5,000 to $200,000. DNA Funded offers an 80% profit split by default, with an option to increase it to 90% via a paid add-on. Withdrawals are processed every 14 days, but traders can reduce this to 7 days by purchasing an early payout add-on. Unlike many proprietary trading firms, DNA Funded allows profit withdrawals from as little as $1, ensuring maximum flexibility.Markets & LeverageDNA Funded provides access to over 800 financial instruments, making it one of the most diverse prop trading firms for Indian traders.Forex \u2013 Major, minor, and exotic currency pairs, including USD/INR (up to 1:50 leverage).Commodities \u2013 Gold, silver, crude oil, and natural gas (up to 1:10 leverage).Indices \u2013 Global indices such as NIFTY 50, US30, and GER40 (up to 1:10 leverage).Stocks \u2013 US and European equities (up to 1:10 leverage).Cryptocurrencies \u2013 Available for Single Helix and Double Helix challenges (up to 1:2 leverage).Trading PlatformsDNA Funded supports two trading platforms, both with distinct advantages:TradeLocker \u2013 A modern, web-based platform integrated with TradingView, featuring one-click execution, advanced charting tools, and a mobile-friendly interface. Recommended for manual traders and those who rely on TradingView indicators.DXTrade \u2013 A simple yet functional platform suited for beginners, though some execution delays were noted during testing, making it less ideal for high-frequency traders.Trust & SupportDNA Funded is a newly launched prop trading firm, but its partnership with DNA Markets\u2014an ASIC-regulated forex broker\u2014adds credibility to its offering. The prop firm has received positive early feedback for its transparent fee structure and strong trading conditions. It is also actively building a trader community through Discord, providing support, strategy discussions, and firm updates. Payouts can be requested as early as 3 days for certain accounts, but others have withdrawal cycles of 14 or 30 days. A key drawback for high-volume forex traders is the commission fee of $4 per lot, which is above industry averages.Markets & LeverageThe Funded Trader provides access to a wide range of instruments, though leverage varies across account types.Forex \u2013 1:200 leverage during challenges, reduced to 1:100 in funded accounts.Indices \u2013 1:20 leverage for most challenges, lowered to 1:5 in the Knight Challenge.Commodities & Metals \u2013 1:30 leverage, covering assets like gold and silver.Crypto \u2013 1:2 leverage in challenges, reduced to 1:1 in funded accounts, limiting crypto trading flexibility.Trading PlatformsThe Funded Trader supports MT5, cTrader, Match-Trader, and DXTrade. However, traders who prefer cTrader must pay a $25 add-on fee, and DXTrade has reported execution issues, which could impact reliability.Trust & SupportThe Funded Trader has a large community, offering active Discord and social media engagement. However, customer support response times are inconsistent, and rule enforcement has been a concern for some traders. Its lack of broker backing may also be a factor for those looking for more security.Final VerdictThe Funded Trader is a solid choice for traders looking for diverse challenge types, high scaling potential, and an engaged trading community.

Broader market indices like Nifty midcap and small-cap finished down 0.6 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively. With crucial economic data concerning CPI and IIP from India and the US due post-market closure, analysts pinpoint ongoing corrections driven by factors like GDP contraction, trade deficits, and currency depreciation. Experts recommend accumulating value stocks for missed opportunities while current investors should hedge and remain optimistic for recovery, according to Stock Market Today's Co-Founder VLA Ambala. In a volatile trading session on Wednesday, the Indian stock markets concluded flat, continuing the trends seen in the previous day. Investor sentiment was affected by worries over overvaluation, tariff war threats, and currency depreciation. At the end of the session, the BSE Sensex was recorded at 74,029.76, a decline of 72.56 points or 0.10 per cent, while the Nifty of the National Stock Exchange fell by 27.40 points or 0.12 per cent to close at 22,470.50. Nifty opened positively but succumbed to selling pressure during the day, finishing on a negative note at 22,471. The volatility index, India VIX, decreased by 2.70 per cent to 13.69, indicating a reduction in market volatility. The Bank Nifty index showed resilience, maintaining buying interest and closing higher at 48,057. Technical and Derivatives Analyst Sundar Kewat cited global trade tensions, particularly President Trump's threats to increase tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, as key factors dampening investor sentiment.

While it offers helpful features, there are some limitations to consider. In behavioral economics, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cnudging\u201d \u2014 small, thoughtful prompts that help us make better decisions without being intrusive. Budgeting apps often claim to be that nudge, but not all of them deliver. Some simply log your spending after the fact, while others try to guide you toward smarter money habits in real time. Stretch aims to differentiate itself from standard budgeting apps by offering more comprehensive tools for financial management. While budgeting apps are plentiful, Stretch offers several useful features: Stretch offers a 7-day free trial, after which the Vision subscription costs $9.99 monthly for the first three months with promotional code SAVE3FOR3. Regular pricing is $12.99 monthly. If you\u2019re particularly focused on debt management and benefit from real-time feedback, Stretch\u2019s comprehensive dashboard might justify its $12.99 monthly subscription cost. The app can serve as a middle ground between basic free budgeting tools and more expensive financial advisory services. Do you prefer having all your accounts \u2014 loans, credit cards and savings \u2014 visible in one dashboard? In-app notifications: Through text or email, Stretch provides reminders about financial goals and payments. Stretch includes features for tracking debt, monitoring credit scores and creating payment plans that may help with credit card debt management. Do you need guidance to develop better financial habits but don\u2019t want to hire a financial advisor? Does Stretch charge fees for its features? Can Stretch help pay off credit card debt? Would real-time spending insights and reminders help you make better financial decisions? Before committing, you can take advantage of Stretch\u2019s free trial period to determine if its features align with your financial management style. This hands-on experience will reveal whether the app\u2019s interface, notification system and debt-tracking capabilities provide genuine value for your situation. Financial stress affects more than your bank account. According to the American Psychological Association, 63 percent of Americans cite money as a significant source of stress. This stress can impact mental health, daily functioning and even physical wellbeing. Stretch Financial Wellness (simply known as \u201cStretch\u201d) aims to take financial management further by focusing on where your money can take you rather than just showing how you spend it. Let\u2019s examine Stretch\u2019s features, benefits and limitations to help you determine if it\u2019s right for your financial goals. Reputable budgeting apps typically employ secure encryption and follow privacy standards to protect financial data. Before signing up for any financial service, verify its security features and privacy policy. Financial education: Learn what you need to know with easy-to-understand info designed to boost your financial confidence and knowledge. This financial literacy gap is reflected in Americans\u2019 saving habits. According to\u00a0Bankrate\u2019s 2024 Emergency Savings Report, 32 percent of consumers have less money in savings than they did a year ago, and 9 percent say they have no savings at all. In these cases, you might be better served by financial planning software with more advanced features, consulting with a financial advisor, or using free spreadsheet templates designed for budgeting. Is debt management (especially credit cards) a primary financial goal for you? Financial wellness extends beyond money management \u2014 it\u2019s about having the freedom to make choices that improve your quality of life without constant financial worry. Whether handling unexpected expenses or saving for long-term goals, financial wellness provides greater control over your money and increased peace of mind. Stretch Financial Wellness is an app designed to help users manage their finances with a focus on debt management, real-time insights and guidance for making financial progress. Customized goal setting: Define and track goals like saving for an emergency fund, staying within a budget or paying off debt. Users with debt from smaller lenders using less advanced technology may find that Stretch doesn\u2019t fully integrate with these institutions. Similarly, those managing finances across multiple countries will likely find the app insufficient for their needs, as Stretch isn\u2019t designed to handle international financial complexities. Choosing the right budgeting app starts with understanding your financial needs and habits. To determine if Stretch is a fit for you, consider these questions: But there\u2019s good news: Working toward financial goals, such as debt reduction or emergency fund building, typically correlates with increased confidence and security regardless of income level. Financial wellness creates stability that can improve overall quality of life. Categorized spending insights: The app organizes spending into categories to help users understand spending patterns and make adjustments. AOL Though marketed as a comprehensive financial wellness tool, Stretch may not adequately serve those with complex financial situations due to its limited personalization and absence of human advisor support. Debt management focus: Unlike some general budgeting apps, Stretch provides specific tools for monitoring and reducing debt, including credit score visibility. The $12.99 monthly fee for the Vision subscription may be counterproductive for budget-conscious users, especially since the free version only supports one credit card. Considering the average American has 3.84 credit cards, many users would need to upgrade to the paid plan for full functionality. Centralized dashboard: The Vision subscription allows users to link banking accounts, credit cards and various debts including student loans, car loans and mortgages. Stretch does have notable advantages, including its user-friendly interface, emphasis on progress over perfection and the ability to make payments directly through the app. Unlike some competitors, it offers a free version, albeit with significant limitations. Are budgeting apps trustworthy? Advertisement Real-time insights: Get up-to-date notifications on your spending and savings so you can adjust in the moment. The competitive budgeting app landscape includes alternatives like You Need a Budget (YNAB) and PocketGuard, which offer similar benefits at comparable price points. For premium support please call: Financial marketplace: Users can explore financial products from selected institutions, including credit cards, loans, bank accounts and more. The app provides tools to help users understand their financial situation, plan for the future and work toward personal financial goals. It approaches financial management by breaking down complex concepts into more manageable steps and providing actionable insights. Have basic budgeting apps failed to give you the structure and motivation you need? The 2024 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index shows that financial literacy in the U.S. has remained at about 50 percent for eight years, with a 2 percent decline in the past two years. This knowledge gap often leads to financial decisions that can make progress difficult. If you answered yes to most of these questions, Stretch could be beneficial. However, consider alternative solutions if you have complex financial circumstances requiring personalized advice, manage finances across international borders, are already comfortable using spreadsheets or other low-cost alternatives, or find that the subscription cost doesn\u2019t fit your budget.", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/washington/2025/03/11/are-we-going-into-recession-trump-stokes-fears-us-washington/82273513007/": "\u201cThe economy will likely suffer a downturn if the Trump administration follows through on the tariff increases it has announced and maintains those tariffs for more than a few months,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, posted on X on Monday. Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson previously said that retaliatory tariffs from Canada could impact \"at least $296 million in Washington agricultural exports.\" He added that Trump's tariffs would also raise living costs for Washington families and make the state's exports less competitive on the world stage. With the\u00a0stock market tumbling, consumer confidence skidding, and U.S. companies ramping up layoffs, it may look like the nation is hurtling toward a\u00a0recession\u00a0amid\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s widening global trade war and federal job cuts. Washington state exported $57.8 billion worth of goods to the world in 2024, making it the ninth-largest state exporter\u00a0that year, according to the\u00a0Office of the United States Trade Representative, or USTR. The state's largest market was China, where it exported $12 billion worth of goods, followed by Canada ($7.9 billion), Japan ($5 billion), Mexico ($4.3 billion),\u00a0and South Korea ($3 billion). Speaking to NPR's \"Morning Edition\" program on March 11, Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said Americans should focus on two pieces of data: employment growth and household spending. \"So I would say if the job market turns negative and we're laying off private and public sector workers, that's the key No. 1 criterion,\" Gapen said in the interview. \"After that, I'd say it's more about household spending. Personal consumption.\" But trouble spots are mounting. Economists are raising their inflation forecasts and downgrading their 2025 growth estimates. Here's what to know about the economic indicators of a recession and how Trump's policies might affect Washington state's economic outlook. It wasn't all rosy, however. In December 2024, pending home sales in Washington were down 5.1% year-over-year, according to the OFM. Goldman Sachs has bumped the chances of a slump from 15% to a still-modest 20%, but only because it still reckons the White House will pull back \u201cif the downside risks begin to look more serious.\" JPMorgan Chase figures there\u2019s a 40% chance of a downturn. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index fell 2.7% Monday, compounding last week\u2019s losses, and it\u2019s down 8.7% from its record high in mid-February. That\u2019s a big worry because the effects of wealth gains or losses on consumer spending are four times as large now as during the previous two economic cycles, economist Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics said. Trump has targeted China, Canada, and Mexico with tariffs and threats. Washington's economic outlook was largely positive, according to OFM's report, which was released in February. The monthly count of initial claims for unemployment insurance decreased by 1,900 in January 2025. In housing, 40,400 building permits were issued in December 2024, up by 4,500 from the previous year. The OFM also reported that the net percentage of lenders willing to make consumer loans was up 5.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2025. The unemployment rate in Washington state was 4.5% in December 2024, according to the latest data reported by the state's Office of Financial Management. This represents a 0.3% year-over-year increase. Washington's nonfarm jobs rose by 40,000 monthly, a 1.1% increase from the previous year. Cascade PBS reported a \"big uptick\" in federal workers applying for unemployment insurance in Washington state, as billionaire Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency pursues federal job cuts. The gambit would sharply raise consumer prices and sap Americans' purchasing power while ratcheting up business uncertainty, experts say, curtailing investment and hiring. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines recession as a \"significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\" There isn't a strict way to calculate whether the U.S. is in a recession, but economists keep a close eye on a few monthly economic indicators, such as income, employment, consumption, sales, and industrial production, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The U.S. added 151,000 jobs in February, and the national unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, the Labor Department reported. Federal government employment declined, coinciding with the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. Consumer spending declined 2% in January. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics traced some of the drop to severe winter weather but noted early retail sales indicators in February point to a further retreat. \"As of March 5, 952 federal employees have filed unemployment claims with Washington\u2019s Employment Security Department this year \u2013 about double the number of claims from the same time period last year, which saw 472 claims,\" the public media outlet reported, noting that most of the claims were filed after Trump took office. Some analysts say it\u2019s likely the nation will topple into a downturn if Trump moves ahead with all of the\u00a0tariffs\u00a0he has threatened on a broad range of imported goods. USA TODAY contributed to this report. There may be other signs of economic instability. U.S.-based employers announced plans in February to cut 172,017\u00a0jobs, the \"highest total for the month since 2009,\" according to global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. It isn\u2019t \u2013 yet. That's mostly because American consumers are still in good financial shape, and the nation\u2019s businesses generally remain\u00a0optimistic\u00a0despite growing uncertainty about the trade conflicts and federal cuts, forecasters say.", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/12/business/inflation-cpi-economy-new-england/": "Advertise Do Not Sell My Personal Information Gift Subscriptions Co-op Program Internship Program Digital Access Newsletters That momentum, combined with a slowing economy, could give the Federal Reserve more flexibility to lower interest rates if the economy weakens.

The CPI figures could notably impact the US Dollar (USD) and the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) cautious monetary policy stance. Inflation in the United States (US), as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), declined to 2.8% on a yearly basis in February from 3% in January, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on Wednesday. This reading came in below the market expectation of 2.9%. On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.2% following the 0.5% increase recorded in January. Therefore, stakes are high heading into the US CPI showdown as the inflation report could shed fresh light on the direction of the Fed\u2019s interest rates and the USD. \u201cOn a year-over-year (YoY) basis, headline and core CPI inflation are likely to drop by a tenth each to 2.9% and 3.2%, respectively,\u201d TDS analysts said. On a monthly basis, a 0.3% increase is projected for the headline CPI and the core CPI inflation figures. A bigger-than-expected cooldown in the annual headline and core inflation prints could shake off concerns over risks to the disinflation path, compelling Fed to resume rate cuts while exacerbating the Greenback\u2019s pain. Although tariffs and taxes both generate government revenue to fund public goods and services, they have several distinctions. Tariffs are prepaid at the port of entry, while taxes are paid at the time of purchase. Taxes are imposed on individual taxpayers and businesses, while tariffs are paid by importers.

During the run-up to the presidential election in November 2024, Donald Trump made it clear that he intends to use tariffs to support the US economy and American producers. In 2024, Mexico, China and Canada accounted for 42% of total US imports. In this period, Mexico stood out as the top exporter with $466.6 billion, according to the US Census Bureau. Hence, Trump wants to focus on these three nations when imposing tariffs. He also plans to use the revenue generated through tariffs to lower personal income taxes. \u201cEUR/USD needs acceptance above the November 6 2024 high of 1.0937 to extend the uptrend toward the 1.1000 psychological level. The next relevant bullish targe is seen at the 1.1050 mark. Conversely, the immediate support is at the 200-day SMA at 1.0721, below which the March 5 low of 1.0602 will be tested. The 21-day SMA at 1.0546 will be buyers' last defence.\u201d Against mounting US economic slowdown concerns and President Donald Trump-led global tariff war, markets are now pricing in 85 basis points (bps) of easing from the Fed this year, compared to 75 bps on Monday, per the LSEG Fed interest rate probabilities. \u00a92025 \"FXStreet\" All Rights Reserved On the other hand, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated on Friday that the US central bank would take a cautious approach to monetary policy easing, adding that the economy currently \"continues to be in a good place\".

The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.1% on a yearly basis. This print followed the 3.3% increase in January and came in below analysts' estimate of 3.2%. On a monthly basis, the core CPI rose 0.2%. The recent slew of US data releases has been quite discouraging, especially with the February Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday showing that the US economy added 151,000 jobs in February, compared with an expected rise of 160,000 and a previous downward revision of 125,000. The Unemployment Rate climbed to 4.1% versus expectations of 4%. The Labor Force Participation Rate ticked a tad lower to 62.4% in the same period from January\u2019s 62.6%.

Dhwani Mehta, Asian Session Lead Analyst at FXStreet, offers a brief technical outlook for EUR/USD and explains: \u201cEUR/USD\u2019s near-term technical picture points to a likely buyer exhaustion as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the daily chart sits within the overbought territory above 70.

There are two schools of thought among economists regarding the usage of tariffs. While some argue that tariffs are necessary to protect domestic industries and address trade imbalances, others see them as a harmful tool that could potentially drive prices higher over the long term and lead to a damaging trade war by encouraging tit-for-tat tariffs.", "https://www.aol.com/finance/wall-streets-hopes-2025-ipo-080024776.html": "Nvidia is both a big backer and client to the company. So is ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This week, CoreWeave struck a $11.9 billion contract with OpenAI that included CoreWeave\u2019s services, along with a private stake in the company. Companies like CoreWeave seeking to go public are weighing their recent concerns of market volatility against how quickly their private capital and insider demands for payouts need to be replenished, according to Renaissance\u2019s Marquez. But the uncertainty surrounding the administration\u2019s trade policies is roiling markets and raising new concerns about the direction of the US economy and inflation, likely making it tougher for bankers and executives to pull the trigger on a public listing. \u201cRight now, our outlook is a little bit negative,\u201d Avery Marquez, a portfolio manager for IPO-focused ETF provider Renaissance Capital, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a little bit more caution than we did at the beginning of the year, but I think we're very heartened by the fact that we're still seeing companies filing.\u201d Hopes for an IPO bonanza in the first year of the new Trump era are being put to the test. Some companies that have tested the public markets so far this year have experienced setbacks. One is Venture Global Inc. (VG), a liquefied natural gas exporter that watched its stock fall roughly 60% since a January listing. Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance One challenge ahead for a CoreWeave IPO is that investors are beginning to reset the big bets they\u2019ve made on the future of AI growth. \"The early IPOs that we have seen ... haven't really given a vote of confidence for other companies to follow,\" Brianne Lynch, EquityZen head of market insight, told Yahoo Finance, citing the example of Venture Global. But those plans could change if the stock market\u2019s recent whipsaw movements persist. Customer service software provider Gensys has already postponed its plans to go public in April or May, according to a report from the Information. But those results are still well short of 2021, the last boom year for dealmaking. The value of 2025's IPO deals so far is on track to underperform the average year of the past decade, while the number of deals so far is higher.

The good news for Wall Street is that, so far this year, the total value of US IPOs is up 62%, according to Dealogic, hitting $10 billion as of March 11. The number of deals has nearly doubled, to 63 from 33 during the same period in 2024. \"There is potential, especially if we got more specific actions on the regulatory front, to unleash more animal spirits,\" he said. It filed for an IPO in late February and aims to raise about $4 billion at an expected target valuation of more than $35 billion, according to a Bloomberg report. \"I think a lot of investors are hoping a Big Tech company like CoreWeave could be the one to reverse that trend because, certainly, we aren't seeing strong IPO traction yet.\" However, Lynch of EquityZen expects that valuable startups considering their next move are content to grow in the private markets while they \"wait out the volatility.\" A major IPO to watch in the coming weeks or months is CoreWeave, a startup that provides data center infrastructure to the likes of Microsoft and Nvidia. It is proving to be integral to the booming needs created by tech companies' artificial intelligence efforts. AOL CoreWeave\u2019s IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, along with 11 other advisers. At the beginning of the year, bankers were wildly optimistic that the Trump administration\u2019s pro-growth agenda and deregulatory stance would unleash the market\u2019s animal spirits and spur a flurry of US deals handled by big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). But \"that just isn't the case right now,\" Marquez added. \u201cNormally, when you have a sell-off like the one that we've been having, in addition to just volatility and macro uncertainty, you're seeing headlines of companies pumping the brakes, killing their IPO plan,\u201d he said.

But now, he said, \u201cit's very difficult to price an IPO when we're getting these swings in the market.\u201d \"It's questionable when these IPOs might happen,\" she added.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, central banks have lifted their holdings of gold significantly and the US dollar\u2019s share of their reserves has been sliding. The US trade deficit of $US131.4 billion was driven by the record $US329.5 billion of imports \u2013 $US36 billion more than in December \u2013 that included $US30.8 billion of gold and other precious metals. The average monthly imports of gold to the US in recent years has been about $US1.7 billion, so the January volumes were eyebrow-raising. Gold is another asset regarded, historically, as a safe repository, and it hasn\u2019t dulled its allure in such uncertain times that, as US bond yields have dropped, so has the opportunity cost of investing in gold, an asset that generates no income. The gold price is surging as uncertainty reigns. Credit: Getty There are a lot of things the US doesn\u2019t produce, and it would take time before it could build the factories or mines to produce them. Trump\u2019s tariffs are going to produce a major supply-side shock \u2013 and a spike in inflation \u2013 to the US economy. While its export growth has cooled this year, China recorded a record trade surplus last year, with a surge in exports towards the end of the year as US importers scrambled to get in ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs. US companies across the economy are building excess stocks of goods and commodities as a buffer against the increased costs the tariffs will bring. Traditionally, the US Treasuries market has been the world\u2019s safe haven, and it is notable that the benchmark 10-year bond yield has dropped about half a percentage point this year as Trump has rolled out his tariff plans. Gold has historically been a hedge against inflation and US dollar weakness (because gold is priced in US dollars a weaker dollar makes it cheaper to acquire) and therefore it represents something of a safe haven in the volatile environment Trump has created. We\u2019re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We\u2019re working to restore it. Please try again later. China\u2019s holdings of US Treasuries, for instance, have tumbled from about $US1.2 trillion at their peak to less than $US760 billion even as it has built its gold reserves, which were 44 tonnes higher at the end of last year than at the end of 2023. The novel surplus Australia had with the US \u2013 for the best part of 40 years, we\u2019ve run trade deficits with America \u2013 was largely due to record shipments of gold \u2013 $US2.9 billion ($4.6 billion) of the precious metal in a month. That\u2019s more than double the exports of gold to the US over the entire 2024 calendar year. While the premium has since subsided to less than $US10 an ounce, at one point earlier this year, it blew out to $US60 an ounce, creating a very profitable trade. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Trump\u2019s ill trade winds are, at least, blowing some investors some good. They are generating massive levels of uncertainty and have cast a dark cloud over the outlook for global growth, which is the kind of environment within which gold prospers. Bullion is usually stored in London, at the Bank of England, or in private vaults because storage costs are low, and the London gold market is deep and liquid. Trump appears to be revelling in creating uncertainty. Credit: Bloomberg The gold price has risen more than 10 per cent since the start of this year to trade at record levels. Such was the scramble to get the gold to New York ahead of any tariffs; however, there were weeks-long queues to withdraw gold from the Bank of England. While it wasn\u2019t helpful, while the federal government was arguing, unsuccessfully as it has transpired, for an exemption from Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on aluminium and steel, the Australian experience of a surge in exports of gold to the US is, therefore, part of a larger phenomenon. The gold price has also been aided by the response of governments and their central banks to the increasing weaponisation of the US dollar\u2019s dominance of international finance and trade, most notably when it was deployed to enable the seizure of Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves held offshore. The ill-timed trade surplus Australia recorded with the US in January isn\u2019t unique. A record US trade deficit that same month was driven by a surge of imports, with the common theme between the Australian and US experiences being record volumes of gold. Trump is keeping markets on their toes. Credit: Bloomberg Whether or not that leads to a US recession, the prospect of which has spooked financial markets, the ominous outlook for the economy that Trump\u2019s trade policies are creating is generating a rush towards safe havens. The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day\u2019s trading. Get it each weekday afternoon. There has also been an increase in US domestic steel and aluminium prices relative to prices elsewhere, as domestic producers have lifted their prices (and profitability) to take advantage of the shelter provided by the tariffs. Copyright \u00a9 2025 There\u2019s also been an arbitrage opportunity for the traders to exploit by shifting physical tonnes of gold to the US from their vaults in London and elsewhere. A similar phenomenon has occurred in copper after Trump said he might impose tariffs on that metal, with the trans-Atlantic price gap blowing out to $US1000 a tonne at its peak as traders shipped copper from London warehouses to the US. The massive surge in US gold imports that has helped lift the price is due to the fear of traders and the industrial users of gold in the US getting ahead of any tariff that Trump might impose on the metal. Trump hasn\u2019t, so far, included gold in his musing on tariffs, but he has referred to the potential for a tariff on copper and, obviously, has slapped tariffs on aluminium and steel. His tariffs will add to US inflation, subtract from economic growth and weaken the US dollar, all of which favours higher gold prices. In the scramble to shift their gold stocks from London to the Commodity Exchange (COMEX) in New York, traders pushed prices higher in the New York futures market than gold was trading in the spot market in London. As with other distortions to financial markets that have been developing this year, the explanation for the unusual activity in the gold market lies with Trump\u2019s tariffs and the fear and uncertainty they have been generating. Traders normally try to avoid moving physical gold because of the cost and because, where gold in the UK is held in 400 oz bars, COMEX only accepts 1-kilogram bars. That means the gold has to be recast, generally in Switzerland, one of the world\u2019s key refining and transit centres for the metal, adding to the transit costs. Trump\u2019s tariffs have unsettled traditional allies and foes alike. They have raised the prospect of a tit-for-tat global trade war as those targeted by Trump for either specific tariffs or the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs (tariffs that match other economies\u2019 tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers) retaliate.", "https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/events-and-conferences/aim-congress-2025-to-host-roundtables-addressing-key-global-investment-trends-and-challenges-nyu3c78h": "To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this website, its parent company, its subsidiaries, its affiliates and the respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, advertisers, content providers and licensors will not be liable (jointly or severally) to you for any direct, indirect, consequential, special, incidental, punitive or exemplary damages, including without limitation, lost profits, lost savings and lost revenues, whether in negligence, tort, contract or any other theory of liability, even if the parties have been advised of the possibility or could have foreseen any such damages.

Following the bearish action seen on Monday and Tuesday, a decisive rebound in Wall Street's main indexes could make it difficult for the USD to find demand. Gold prices accelerate their weekly recovery and flirt with the key $2,940 mark per troy ounce on Wednesday on the back of the lack of direction in the Greenback, tariff concerns and cooling US inflation. The generalised optimism in the risk-linked universe coupled with the irresolute price action in the Greenback bolsters the move higher in GBP/USD, which re-shifts its attention to the 1.3000 threshold.

The table below shows the percentage change of British Pound (GBP) against listed major currencies this week. British Pound was the strongest against the Canadian Dollar. After rising to a fresh multi-month high near 1.2970 on Tuesday, GBP/USD corrects lower and trades below 1.2950 in the European session on Wednesday. The positive shift seen in risk mood, however, could help the pair hold its ground in the near term.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in prices of a basket of goods and services over a period of time. It is usually expressed as a percentage change on a month-on-month (MoM) and year-on-year (YoY) basis. Core CPI is the figure targeted by central banks as it excludes volatile food and fuel inputs. When Core CPI rises above 2% it usually results in higher interest rates and vice versa when it falls below 2%. Since higher interest rates are positive for a currency, higher inflation usually results in a stronger currency. The opposite is true when inflation falls.

Formerly, Gold was the asset investors turned to in times of high inflation because it preserved its value, and whilst investors will often still buy Gold for its safe-haven properties in times of extreme market turmoil, this is not the case most of the time. This is because when inflation is high, central banks will put up interest rates to combat it. Higher interest rates are negative for Gold because they increase the opportunity-cost of holding Gold vis-a-vis an interest-bearing asset or placing the money in a cash deposit account. On the flipside, lower inflation tends to be positive for Gold as it brings interest rates down, making the bright metal a more viable investment alternative.

GBP/USD remains in the upper half of the ascending regression channel and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the 4-hour chart holds above 60, reflecting the bullish stance. Later in the session, February inflation data from the US will be scrutinized by market participants. On a monthly basis, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 0.3%, after increasing 0.4% in January. A stronger-than-forecast core monthly inflation print could cause investors to refrain from pricing in a rate cut in May and help the US Dollar (USD) stay resilient against its rivals. On the flip side, a reading of 0.2%, or lower, in this data could trigger another leg lower in the USD and open the door for additional gains in GBP/USD.

We believe newer client segments will look for private markets firms to tailor solutions that meet their individual needs. Partners Group is a global leader in providing portfolio solutions at scale and has a track record of innovation. We already have the industry\u2019s highest proportion of AuM in bespoke solutions, but our goal is to be the market leader in providing portfolio solutions across all client segments. In doing so, we aim to generate attractive returns not only for our investors, but also for our shareholders.\u201d Partners Group anticipates that the private markets industry will more than double in size over the next decade. A larger portion of this AuM growth will flow from investor groups that historically have had little exposure to the asset class, such as private wealth, defined contribution pensions, and insurance capital. Indices [5] As of 7 March 2025; includes proposed dividend of CHF 42.00 per share to be paid for the financial year 2024, subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to be held on 21 May 2025. Partners Group listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange in 2006, with an initial market capitalization of CHF 1.7 billion. Since then, it has delivered substantial value to shareholders, with share price growth of 18% p.a. and dividend growth of 17% p.a.[5] AuM growth in USD stood at 16% p.a. and EBITDA[6] growth at 13% p.a. in the same timeframe. As of 7 March 2025, Partners Group had a market capitalization of CHF 35 billion. [2] AuM growth expectations are by end of 2033. Steffen Meister, Executive Chairman of the Board, Partners Group, says: \u201cAfter phases of initiation and institutionalization of private markets investment, the industry has entered its next cycle, in which democratization of access and industry consolidation will be the key drivers of allocations. At the same time, we are seeing an accelerated transformation of the economy due to rapid technological advances. This changing environment favors larger managers like Partners Group, which have the scale to be consolidators in a fragmented market and the resources to take an active approach to asset ownership. Our transformational approach to investing, with its focus on thematic sourcing, cross-sector collaboration, and entrepreneurial governance, positions us well to capture future investment opportunities across private markets.\u201d Partners Group\u2019s Capital Markets Day is taking place at an inflection point for the USD 15 trillion[4] private markets industry. Following more than two decades of growth in institutional allocations, an increasing share of the real economy is under the stewardship of private markets and the asset class is entering the mainstream of investment management.

Following a tense White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, any signs of easing geopolitical tensions could buoy risk sentiment and favour currencies like the Euro. Gold prices accelerate their weekly recovery and flirt with the key $2,940 mark per troy ounce on Wednesday on the back of the lack of direction in the Greenback, tariff concerns and cooling US inflation. The generalised optimism in the risk-linked universe coupled with the irresolute price action in the Greenback bolsters the move higher in GBP/USD, which re-shifts its attention to the 1.3000 threshold. The author and FXStreet are not registered investment advisors and nothing in this article is intended to be investment advice. Back to the Greenback, the US Dollar Index (DXY) moved further south, reaching the 103.30 region for the first time since mid-October. Furthermore, it is worth noting the index has almost fully faded the \u201cTrump trade\u201d that was behind the October-January rally. On the Federal Reserve side, the most recent decision kept rates in the 4.25%\u20134.50% range, with Chair Jerome Powell emphasising solid US fundamentals, contained inflation, and a tight labour market. However, trade-driven price increases could complicate the Fed\u2019s policy outlook. In case bears regain the upper hand, the 200-day SMA at 1.0725 provides the first key support, followed by the interim 100-day SMA at 1.0518 and the 55-day SMA at 1.0433. Further down, levels of note include 1.0359 (February 28 low), 1.0282 (February 10 low), 1.0209 (February 3), and 1.0176 (2025 bottom from January 13). Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you.

EUR/USD daily chart On the old continent, the European Central Bank (ECB) trimmed its key rates by 25 basis points, suggesting it might consider further easing if uncertainties persist, including those stemming from trade frictions and increased military spending. The ECB also lowered its growth forecasts for the Eurozone while slightly raising near-term inflation projections, though it expects price pressures to stabilise by 2026. \u00a92025 \"FXStreet\" All Rights Reserved SPONSORED Discover the top brokers for trading EUR/USD in 2025.

Investors are increasingly uneasy about the strength of the US economy, especially in light of President Trump\u2019s changing stance on trade issues. New US tariffs\u201425% on Canadian and Mexican goods and 20% on Chinese imports\u2014have raised fears of retaliatory actions, even though the USMCA partners received a temporary reprieve until April 2. According to latest news, Trump announced an extra 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminium, adding to the already sour mood among market participants.

The Euro extended further the optimistic start to the week, advancing well past the 1.0900 hurdle to reach fresh five-month tops around 1.0940, always on the back of the intense downtrend in the US Dollar (USD) and reinforced by hopes that the announced defence/infrastructure deal in Germany could be reached in the next few days.

While tariffs can drive inflation and potentially lead the Federal Reserve (Fed) to tighten policy, they can also undermine economic growth, which might prompt the Fed to adopt a more cautious approach, further complicating the Dollar\u2019s outlook. Immediate resistance stands at 1.0946, the 2025 high from March 11. A decisive break above that level could lead the pair toward 1.0969, which corresponds to the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the September\u2013January decline. EUR/USD still cannot capitalise on the US Dollar's inconclusive price action, retreating modestly to the 1.0900 neighbourhood as market participants continue to adjust to the lower-than-expected US inflation data in February. Bitcoin (BTC), XRP and Solana (SOL) prices struggle on Wednesday. The three tokens rank in the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and the risk-off sentiment in the crypto market has ushered in a cooling-off period. In the near term, EUR/USD will be influenced by multiple factors, including potential shifts in trade policies, central bank divergence, Eurozone growth prospects boosted by Germany\u2019s infrastructure and defence plans, and any geopolitical developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In addition, momentum indicators reflect a (very) overbought market, with the RSI hovering around 77 and the Average Directional Index (ADX) rising to nearly 25, signalling a strengthening trend.", "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/money-transfer/currency-converter/usd-ssp/": "2 Money transfers up to 8x cheaper than traditional banks Initiate transfers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week You might be using an unsupported or outdated browser.

The generalised optimism in the risk-linked universe coupled with the irresolute price action in the Greenback bolsters the move higher in GBP/USD, which re-shifts its attention to the 1.3000 threshold. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will play a key role in influencing market expectations about the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-cut path, which, in turn, will drive the US Dollar (USD) demand and provide a fresh impetus to the GBP/USD pair. In the meantime, some repositioning trade ahead of the crucial data assists the buck to recover a part of the previous day's slide to its lowest level since mid-October and acts as a headwind for the currency pair. The author and FXStreet are not registered investment advisors and nothing in this article is intended to be investment advice. Even from a technical perspective, last week's sustained breakout above the very important 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) was seen as a key trigger for bulls and suggests that the path of least resistance for the currency pair is to the upside. Hence, any further corrective slide might still be seen as a buying opportunity and is more likely to remain limited. Another significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance. The single most important factor influencing the value of the Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of \u201cprice stability\u201d \u2013 a steady inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of interest rates. When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. When inflation falls too low it is a sign economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects. Data releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP. A strong economy is good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall. The Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data. Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, also known as \u2018Cable\u2019, which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the \u2018Dragon\u2019 as it is known by traders (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE). Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.

Any meaningful USD appreciation, however, seems elusive in the wake of growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates several times this year amid worries about a tariff-driven slowdown in the US economic activity. Apart from this, expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut rates more slowly than other central banks, including the Fed, might underpin the British Pound (GBP) and lend support to the GBP/USD pair.

The BoC is under significant pressure to continue lowering interest rates. The Canadian Dollar is poised to continue falling in the first quarter. However, CAD investors will be looking to reassess the state of play between the Fed and the BoC heading into the middle quarters of the year. Read more details about the forecast.

Jerome Powell took office as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in February 2018, for a four-year term ending in February 2022. His term as a member of the Board of Governors will expire January 31, 2028. Born in WashingtonD.C., he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in politics from Princeton University in 1975 and earned a law degree from Georgetown University in 1979. Powell served as an assistant secretary and as undersecretary of the Treasury under PresidentGeorge H.W. Bush. He also worked as a lawyer and investment banker in New York City.

Tiff Macklem was born in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, in 1961. He was appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada, effective 3 June 2020, for a seven-year term. He is the tenth governor of the Bank of Canada. As Governor, he is also Chairman of the Boardof Directors of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). He currently chairs both, the BIS Audit Committee and the Consultative Council for the Americas. In terms of economic data, we should highlight the Trade Account Balance, a balance between exports and imports of total goods and services. A positive value shows trade surplus, while a negative value shows trade deficit. It is an event that generates some volatility for the USD/CAD. If a steady demand in exchange for CAD exports is seen, that would turn into a positive growth in the trade balance, and that should be positive for the CAD.

The YoY reading compares the prices of goods in the reference month to the same month a year earlier.The CPI is a key indicator to measure inflation and changes in purchasing trends.

Companies continue to embrace flexible work setups, recognizing that they reduce costs and unlock access to global talent. The hybrid model lets employees split their time between the office and home all while keeping teams connected and preserving company culture. Blockchain technology, together with cryptocurrencies, is reshaping financial operations and boosting data security. Blockchain enables secure data sharing through its applications which also extend to supply chain management and contract execution systems. The decentralized operating system creates transparent environments that lower the possibility of fraudulent transactions. Organizations that implement blockchain technologies improve workflow speed and develop better relationships with their business partners. Staying continuously informed about emerging regulations and evolving technologies is important in this field. Modern technologies and sustainable practices help both traditional and modern businesses to achieve operational efficiency as well as better customer satisfaction. Industry advancements come from the fast growth of digital technologies, expanding cybersecurity threats and increasing remote work adoption. The process of improving customer experience requires businesses to study customer paths from start to finish while eliminating obstacles and delivering superior results throughout the customer journey. This customer-centric approach differentiates businesses in competitive markets. Digital collaboration tools, secure communication platforms, and virtual project management systems are attracting significant business investments to support these transitions. The need for organizational practice changes becomes essential to protect productivity and employee welfare in distributed work settings. AI and ML have become essential pillars of modern business operations. They streamline routine tasks, improve decision-making, and offer customer support. By using AI chatbots to handle routine queries, companies free up their teams to take on more complex challenges while 24/7 customer service is being provided by AI. The critical nature of data as an organizational asset enables businesses to base their decisions on facts. Making data-driven decisions means gathering and analyzing information to guide both day-to-day operations and long-term strategies. Organizations that use data effectively discover market patterns while improving operational processes and achieving better customer satisfaction. Building an effective omnichannel strategy means investing in technology that integrates inventory management and personalized marketing. Such customer experience integration creates loyal customers who drive more sales while maintaining brand loyalty. As companies go digital, the risk of cyberattacks grows, and this is making strong security measures a top priority. Companies must invest in security measures to protect sensitive data and preserve customer trust. The compromise of cybersecurity systems results in substantial financial losses with severe damage to business reputation. Personalization stands as the essential factor that helps businesses stand apart from the vast array of choices consumers encounter today. Companies that customize their products to match customer behaviors develop better relationships that lead to increased customer loyalty. Through AI and data analytics, companies deliver individualized product recommendations, specialized marketing strategies and adapted products and services.", "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gold-price-surges-above-2910-as-trade-war-fuels-heaven-demand-202503112028": " The major currencies that tend to rise during periods of \u201crisk-off\u201d are the US Dollar (USD), the Japanese Yen (JPY) and the Swiss Franc (CHF). The US Dollar, because it is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and because in times of crisis investors buy US government debt, which is seen as safe because the largest economy in the world is unlikely to default. The Yen, from increased demand for Japanese government bonds, because a high proportion are held by domestic investors who are unlikely to dump them \u2013 even in a crisis. The Swiss Franc, because strict Swiss banking laws offer investors enhanced capital protection. Gold prices accelerate their weekly recovery and flirt with the key $2,940 mark per troy ounce on Wednesday on the back of the lack of direction in the Greenback, tariff concerns and cooling US inflation. The generalised optimism in the risk-linked universe coupled with the irresolute price action in the Greenback bolsters the move higher in GBP/USD, which re-shifts its attention to the 1.3000 threshold. Typically, during periods of \u201crisk-on\u201d, stock markets will rise, most commodities \u2013 except Gold \u2013 will also gain in value, since they benefit from a positive growth outlook. The currencies of nations that are heavy commodity exporters strengthen because of increased demand, and Cryptocurrencies rise. In a \u201crisk-off\u201d market, Bonds go up \u2013 especially major government Bonds \u2013 Gold shines, and safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and US Dollar all benefit. The author and FXStreet are not registered investment advisors and nothing in this article is intended to be investment advice. Gold (XAU) rallied on Tuesday as the trade war spurred demand for the yellow metal due to its safe-haven appeal. Upbeat United States (US) jobs data was ignored by traders, who continued to pile on Bullion. XAU/USD is trading at $2,917, up over 1%. The Australian Dollar (AUD), the Canadian Dollar (CAD), the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) and minor FX like the Ruble (RUB) and the South African Rand (ZAR), all tend to rise in markets that are \u201crisk-on\u201d. This is because the economies of these currencies are heavily reliant on commodity exports for growth, and commodities tend to rise in price during risk-on periods. This is because investors foresee greater demand for raw materials in the future due to heightened economic activity. From a technical standpoint, Gold continues to trend up, but buyers need to clear last week\u2019s peak at $2,930 on March 7 high so that buyers can challenge the psychological mark. A breach of the latter will expose the record high at $2,954, followed by the $3,000 mark. Sentiment has recently improved as Canada and the US de-escalated the threat of imposing tariffs. Concerns about an economic slowdown in the US exert downward pressure on US Treasury yields and the Greenback, which is a tailwind for Bullion prices. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s trade tariffs on aluminum and steel imports will go into effect on Wednesday. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that job openings rose in February.

Bitcoin (BTC), XRP and Solana (SOL) prices struggle on Wednesday. The three tokens rank in the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and the risk-off sentiment in the crypto market has ushered in a cooling-off period. In the world of financial jargon the two widely used terms \u201crisk-on\u201d and \u201crisk off'' refer to the level of risk that investors are willing to stomach during the period referenced.

In a \u201crisk-off\u201d market investors start to \u2018play it safe\u2019 because they are worried about the future, and therefore buy less risky assets that are more certain of bringing a return, even if it is relatively modest.", "https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/european-stocks-set-to-halt-four-days-of-losses:-markets-wrap/88996226": "The combined de-grossing activity by hedge funds on Friday and Monday was the largest in four years and ranks among the top events over the past 15 years, according to Goldman Sachs prime desk. Further de-risking isn\u2019t ruled out. \u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P. Bonds \u201cToday\u2019s cooler-than-expected CPI reading was a breath of fresh air, but no one should expect the Fed to start cutting rates immediately,\u201d said Ellen Zentner at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \u201cThe Fed has adopted a wait-and-see posture, and given the uncertainty of how trade and immigration policy will impact the economy, they\u2019re going to want to see more than one month of friendly inflation data.\u201d Today\u2019s inflation release is unambiguously positive for risk assets as there is greater confidence that inflation is not re-accelerating like January\u2019s data showed, which gives policymakers a bit of breathing room and should allow the Fed to loosen policy should signs of labor market weakness emerge, according to Jeff Schulze at ClearBridge Investments. \u201cThrough yesterday, our best guess is that we are currently in the middle innings of this episode,\u201d the trading desk says, adding that each event is unique given its drivers and duration. The gradual rise in stock market volatility over the past month has seen the VIX Index futures curve becoming inverted, with front-end contracts significantly moving above the longer end. That backwardation is worth watching. \u201cIt shows that inflation is moving in the right direction, which is a nice setup as the market starts to prepare for a potential resurgence of inflation from tariffs,\u201d said Skyler Weinand at Regan Capital. The S&P 500 was little changed. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%. Tesla Inc. led gains in megacaps. Intel Corp. jumped about 6%. IRobot Corp., a consumer robotics company, plunged 37% after raising a \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to continue operating. Switzerland has followed America's lead so far. The freezing of USAID funds demands a rethink. The bank\u2019s strategists cut the year-end target for the S&P 500 Index to 6,200 from 6,500, implying an 11% gain from Tuesday\u2019s close. The reduction was also in view of declines in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks. \u201cHistorically, when US corrections continue beyond the 10% mark, the US remains the underperformer over the entire correction,\u201d they wrote in a note. Cryptocurrencies Stocks As we entered 2025, investors\u2019 main economic worry centered around reflation. But as the trade war continues to escalate and as economic policy uncertainty continues to rise, that worry has shifted from inflation to the labor market and the economy as a whole, according to Bret Kenwell at eToro. The unwinds have become broader across regions and sectors, spreading to US technology stocks and European equities, which had not seen risk reduction activity before Friday and Monday. Hedge funds\u2019 net leverage \u201chas fallen sharply over the past few weeks,\u201d according to Goldman, driven in part by increased shorting activity, especially via macro products. \u201cHowever, the Fed will also need to see that inflation expectations are recovering from their recent rise before cutting rates, as a de-anchoring of inflation expectations is what keeps most central bankers up at night, given the challenge it represents to restoring price stability in the future,\u201d he said. Traders are still fully pricing in the first quarter-point interest-rate cut of the year in June, with about 67 basis points of easing seen for all of 2025. Follow The\u00a0Big Take\u00a0daily podcast wherever you listen. Follow us The impact of Commodity Trading Advisors on the heavy selling in recent weeks has been well-understood, but other systematic market participants have also been weighing on equities under the radar. Many countries are cutting back on foreign aid and Switzerland is among them. Do you think it is justified? \u201cIn that respect, it will take more than a few reassuring inflation reports to ease investors\u2019 worries,\u201d he said. \u201cMoving forward, the Fed will soon take center stage, but not just for its latest view on inflation. Investors will want to hear the committee\u2019s stance on the economy and the labor market, while they\u2019ll also be on the lookout for the Fed\u2019s quarterly update to its economic projections.\u201d The CPI increased 0.2% after a sharp 0.5% advance in January, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Excluding often volatile food and energy categories, the so-called core measure rose 0.2% as well. The BLS said nearly half of the advance in the overall measure was due to shelter, but it still decelerated from the prior month. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists lowered their target for the US equity benchmark, and lifted their view on European earnings, in a further sign of growing skepticism on the outlook for the world\u2019s largest economy. To David Russell at TradeStation, a June Fed cut is still on the table because inflation continues to moderate, especially the key shelter category. \u201cOur revised estimates reflect the recently reduced GDP growth forecast of our US economics team, a higher assumed tariff rate, and higher level of uncertainty that is typically associated with a greater equity risk premium,\u201d strategists including David Kostin and Jenny Ma wrote in a note dated Tuesday. The team led by Beata Manthey says the last time US equities underperformed international peers ~9% into a similarly sized market correction was in 2002 \u2013With assistance from Isabelle Lee, Sujata Rao, John Viljoen and Winnie Hsu. Commodities SWI swissinfo.ch - a branch of Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR Realized volatility has moved higher, given the S&P 500 saw nine days with moves exceeding 1% in either direction during the past 20 trading days. As a result, volatility control funds were sold $43.5 billion over the past month, including more than $15 billion on Monday. While the consumer price index rose at the slowest pace in four months, several measures still indicate that inflation is rearing back up again. And with President Donald Trump rolling out a series of tariffs, prices are expected to rise on a variety of goods from food to clothing, testing the resilience of consumers and the broader economy. The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced two basis points to 4.30%. A dollar gauge wavered. Germany\u2019s benchmark yields are close to hitting 3% for the first time in almost 18 months as expectations of an historic debt issuance surge weighs on the securities. (Bloomberg) \u2014 A rally in stocks waned while bond yields climbed as concern about an escalating trade war overshadowed data showing a cooldown in inflation. International stocks can continue outperforming if the US economy slows but avoids a recession, according to Citigroup strategists. Currencies Given volatility is mean-reverting, the currently rich levels would need feeding by sustained large daily moves of 1.5% or more in order to hold the levels. While the CPI print looms large on Wednesday, knock-on effects from systematic buyers \u2014 who sold a lot of exposure over the past month \u2014 can play out and volatility could return to normalized levels. In recent years several US states have adopted more conservative policies on family issues, abortion and education. As a Swiss citizen living there, how do you view this development? Treasuries have been rallying in recent day amid a rout in the equity market that forced money managers to seek shelter in haven assets. Anxiety has been building that President Donald Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 including on-and-off-again tariffs \u2014 will test the resilience of US consumers and the broader economy. Key events this week: Some of the main moves in markets***: \u201cThe White House and the Fed are breathing a sigh of relief because tariffs didn\u2019t filter through to consumer prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a positive for investors because a huge amount of negativity is priced into stocks. For the first time in several weeks, we might get a break in the streak of frightening news. The other shoe didn\u2019t drop, and that could be good news for Wall Street. Next week\u2019s Fed meeting got a little less worrisome.\u201d Anxiety around the impacts of President Donald Trump\u2019s policies continued to roil markets, with Canada unveiling new tariffs against $21 billion of US goods. Equities quickly lost steam, with the S&P 500 little changed after a 1.3% advance. Volatility also continued to hit the Treasury market, with short-term yields reversing a drop seen in the immediate aftermath of the inflation surprise. Rebalancing selling flows from leveraged ETFs now stands at $52 billion, over the past month with $16.5 billion on Monday alone, according to a note from Nomura Securities cross-asset strategist Charlie McElligott. That\u2019s the biggest monthly number in his chart going back to 2022. \u201cOne of the signs of market capitulation is extended periods of VIX inversion between first and second month contracts. Backwardation of 10% or more across multiple trading sessions typically indicates oversold territory,\u201d says Garrett DeSimone, head quant at OptionMetrics. March and April contracts are currently about 2 points apart, which is a gap of 10%. \u201cThis pattern reflects short-term market panic rather than a systemic liquidity crisis, and subsequent mean reversion,\u201d DeSimone says. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the market still has room to bottom out.\u201d Stay informed daily about news in Switzerland with our Briefing in the SWI plus app for the Swiss abroad.", "https://www.brecorder.com/news/40352489/dubai-retains-top-ranking-for-greenfield-fdi-projects-attracts-1424bn-in-2024": "Dubai accounts for a 6.2 percent global market share and a 55 percent share of the Middle East\u2019s total greenfield FDI projects, added the press statement.

For FDI projects, the top sectors were business services (19.2 percent), food and beverages (16.5 percent), software and IT services (14.3 percent), textiles (9.6 percent), and consumer products (8.3 percent), as per the statement. \u201cThe city\u2019s ranking as the world\u2019s No. 1 destination for attracting greenfield FDI for the fourth consecutive year is a testament to its ability not only to set new global benchmarks for sustained, rapid growth but also to continuously evolve its investment proposition in response to changes sweeping the international market.\u201d India topped the list with the highest total estimated FDI capital into Dubai, (21.5 percent), followed by the United States (13.7 percent), France (11 percent), United Kingdom (10 percent) and Switzerland (6.9 percent).

All Rights Reserved. E-Paper | Terms and Conditions | Site Map | Privacy Policy | \u201cSanction programs are changing,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cWe have seen an executive order come out which now designates drug cartels as terrorist organizations. How is that going to work? We don\u2019t have the implementation yet. Given that these cartels are located in Latin America, Central and South America, how does this impact correspondent banking relationships between US banks and their counterparts there in the region? A call for the streamlining of the regulatory agencies is also echoing in several of the federal agencies, including reductions in the workforce. The unknown is how that will impact the examination process going forward and how it will affect what the role of a bank supervisor is right now. \u201cDenial of service can mean the closing of an account, failure to open an account, or denial of a loan that sets up a complaint process with the state regulator, which a bank would have to respond to,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cFlorida is the poster child for these types of laws, and I think we probably have the most stringent one, but this is something that at the federal level has been talked about.\u201d With a flurry of executive orders being rolled out by the presidential administration, the international banking and finance industry waits to see if any established policies will be impacted. \u201cNow, I think it\u2019s pretty clear to everyone, whether it\u2019s a sanctioned organization as a drug cartel or it\u2019s a terrorist organization, banks are not going to want to deal with them, and they\u2019re going to emphasize that to their counterparts,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the executive orders. We understand what they say, but now it\u2019s up to the various agencies within the Treasury Department to implement these executive orders, and that\u2019s the clarity that we\u2019re waiting to see.\u201d Email * \u201cAs an industry,\u201d he added, \u201cwe were still waiting for the final rule to come out, which would have clarified what a bank\u2019s obligations were under the Corporate Transparency Act. We don\u2019t know if that will still occur, so we\u2019ve been advising banks to continue to do what you do, continue to do your due diligence as you did before, until the dust clears, so to speak.\u201d \u201cFor example, the much-talked-about Corporate Transparency Act, which has been a concern, particularly for smaller companies, since its inception is now apparently going to be dialed back and no longer apply to US corporations, but only to foreign corporations doing business in the US,\u201d he said. \u201cBanks, depending upon their charter, are supervised by the Federal Reserve, the OCC or the FDIC, plus the state regulator,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cWhat will this mean going forward? If there is consolidation, will there be one regulator at the federal level? And how will that impact the state regulatory agencies? What will their purpose be going forward? Banks will comply with whatever they\u2019re supposed to comply with. However, we need to be clear on exactly how we do that.\u201d In fact, a similar bill that had been introduced in Congress but never went anywhere now has been reintroduced, he added, \u201cand what we\u2019re waiting to see is if this final bill gets through Congress and signed by the president and passes. We will need to learn what are the criteria that have to be applied, and what are the potential responsibilities and penalties that could be imposed on banks, and that\u2019s an important one because it would almost classify banks as utilities. Everybody has a right to electricity and water, so now it\u2019s framed in a way that maybe everybody has a right to a bank account, regardless of the risk involved and the various risk appetites of the banks.\u201d Comment Another concern the international banking industry is keeping an eye on is the evolution of sanctions. There\u2019s quite a confusion as some of the changes as executive orders with potential rule changes continue to take hold, said David Schwartz, president and CEO of the Financial & International Business Association, a nonprofit trade association dedicated to fostering the growth of international banking through education, advocacy, and networking. Website Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * There\u2019s also a call for what\u2019s called a debanking rule. Florida already has what\u2019s called a Fair Access Rule, which basically was passed over the last couple of years in two sections, Mr. Schwartz continued. One was House Bill 3 two years ago, and then House Bill 989 last year, which set up a standard for customers who feel they were wrongly denied service.

The company expects sales in local currencies to decline in the first half, with a softer first quarter and a sequential improvement in the second quarter. A more positive outlook for the second half is supported by a strong reception of newly launched products and partnerships in both divisions, along with additional launches in 2025. The expectations regarding profitability are based on an average exchange rate forecast for full year 2025 of one euro equaling CHF 0.95 and one US dollar equaling CHF 0.90. Adjusted net profit2 was CHF 103.1 million, down from CHF 164.4 million in 2023, when earnings were significantly boosted by a one-time positive effect related to transitional measures from the Swiss tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were CHF 8.08, compared to CHF 12.88 in 2023. Order entry in the Partnering Business for the full year decreased slightly more than sales as OEM customers adjusted their ordering patterns, shifting from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Despite this shift, the book-to-bill ratio remained close to 1. The Partnering Business generated sales of CHF 537.3 million in 2024 (2023: CHF 622.6 million or CHF 613.1 million in local currencies), marking a decrease of 13.7% in Swiss francs and 12.4% in local currencies. As anticipated, Tecan did not record any meaningful sales from the pass-through of material costs in this segment for 2024, compared to CHF 8.0 million in 2023. Tecan (www.tecan.com) improves people's lives and health by empowering customers to scale healthcare innovation globally from life science to the clinic. Tecan is a pioneer and global leader in laboratory automation. As an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Tecan is also a leader in developing and manufacturing OEM instruments, components and medical devices that are then distributed by partner companies. Founded in Switzerland in 1980, the company has 3,300 employees, with manufacturing, research and development sites in Europe, North America and Asia, and maintains a sales and service network in over 70 countries. In 2024, Tecan generated sales of CHF 934 million (USD 1,062 million; EUR 984 million). Registered shares of Tecan Group are traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange (TECN; ISIN CH0012100191). Cash flow from operating activities was CHF 148.5 million, compared to CHF 160.6 million in 2023. Cash conversion improved to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%). Thanks to solid cash flow management, Tecan's net liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term time deposits, less bank liabilities, loans, and the outstanding bond) increased to CHF 153.7 million as of December 31, 2024, up from CHF 112.6 million on December 31, 2023. [email\u00a0protected] In 2024, Tecan advanced its product portfolio with significant launches in genomics, proteomics, and cell biology. Examples include the Resolvex i300 module, introduced in February, which enhances throughput in proteomics by integrating with the Fluent\u00ae platform, and the Spark Cyto 3D, which supports drug discovery by enabling the analysis of complex 3D cell models. During a Capital Markets Day in October 2024, Tecan previewed Veya\u2122, a multi-omics liquid handling workstation that simplifies lab automation and boosts productivity. Officially launched at the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (SLAS) international conference in San Diego, USA, in January 2025, Veya provides effortless automation by overcoming key barriers in lab automation. 3 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Life Sciences Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 6.4 million). The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Partnering Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 5.3 million). In the second half of 2024, the Life Sciences Business segment experienced moderate order entry growth in local currencies compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio slightly above 1 for the full year. For further information: Highlights 2024 Information by business segment Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications & IR The full 2024 Annual Report and the 2024 Sustainability Report were also published today and can be accessed on the company's website www.tecan.com under Investor Relations. Tecan also expanded its digital ecosystem with the new Introspect analytics platform, enhancing operational insights and service efficiency. This digital expansion benefits customers across both business segments. Proposal for a stable dividend at the Annual General Meeting For participants from Europe: +41 (0)58 310 50 00 or +44 (0)207 107 0613 (UK) Fax +41 (0) 44 922 88 89 Tel. +41 (0) 44 922 84 30 The lower demand for life science instrumentation also had a negative impact on the Partnering Business, influencing both the Cavro\u00ae OEM components business and the contract development and manufacturing revenues for life science instruments in the Paramit product line. Market weakness in China also impacted the Cavro OEM components business and sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence\u2122 product line to larger global OEM customers with significant exposure to China. However, outside China, sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence product line developed positively, with increased contributions from newly launched systems. Sales in the Paramit product line, which served medical market customers, were negatively affected by normalized demand patterns following the replenishment of depleted inventories in 2023, when supply chain disruptions eased, and by the anticipated reduction in sales from the pure pass-through of material costs. These impacts were specific to a single customer and included a model transition, rather than being related to end market conditions. All these factors had a more pronounced impact in the second half of the year, when segment sales decreased by 15.9% in local currencies. Tecan Group Martin Br\u00e4ndle Attachment New launches and rich project pipeline in Partnering Business Life Sciences Business (end-customer business) In 2024, Tecan enhanced its operational resilience by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and continuing to optimize its global organizational footprint. Following the successful transfer of Cavro component production to facilities in Morgan Hill, California, and Penang, Malaysia, and the closure of the San Jose site in 2023, Tecan relocated its genomic reagents site from Redwood City to the expanding Morgan Hill hub at the end of 2024. In Penang, Tecan successfully passed an extensive FDA inspection, laying a strong foundation for future production of medical devices, including class 3 devices. The first medical device production was successfully transitioned to Penang in 2024. Alongside site consolidation, Tecan focused on supply chain optimization and increased vertical integration of manufacturing to leverage the Group's full capabilities and realize cost synergies. Based on the solid cash flows for the full year 2024 and on the basis of an ongoing positive business outlook, the Board of Directors will propose at the Company's Annual General Meeting on April 18, 2024, an unchanged dividend of CHF 3.00 per share. Half of the dividend, i.e., CHF 1.50, will again be paid out from the available capital contribution reserve and is therefore not subject to withholding tax. Adjusted EBITDA1 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) was CHF 164.4 million, down from CHF 220.6 million in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 17.6% of sales (2023: 20.5%), aligning with the revised margin outlook of 16-18%. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, as profitability is highly volume-dependent. However, profitability was supported by a comprehensive cost-reduction program. Additionally, exchange rate movements in major currencies against the Swiss franc negatively impacted the margin by approximately 40 basis points. Enhancing operational resilience through cost-reduction initiatives, while expanding global operations and commercial reach Financial results full-year and second half of 2024 About Tecan Sales in the Life Sciences Business in 2024 reached CHF 397.0 million (2023: CHF 451.8 million or CHF 442.1 million in local currencies), reflecting a decrease of 12.1% in Swiss francs and 10.2% in local currencies. Reduced CAPEX spending by the biopharmaceutical industry globally, along with government and academic customers in the US, resulted in decreased demand for life science research instruments. Additionally, market weakness in China negatively impacted demand, as the announced stimulus program failed to provide any impetus in 2024. Instead, it prompted some customers to delay orders while awaiting funding decisions. Contributing to a more favorable sales development in the Life Sciences Business were recovering consumables sales post-pandemic, a solid service business due to a higher installed base of instruments, and continued strong demand for newly launched products, particularly from genomic diagnostics companies. Recurring sales of services, consumables and reagents increased to 57.6% of segment sales (2023: 52.8%). The adjusted EBITDA3 for this segment was CHF 91.1 million, compared to CHF 125.6 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.9% of sales, compared to 20.1% in 2023. Sales of CHF\u00a0934.3 million (2023: CHF\u00a01,074.4 million), down by -13.0% in Swiss francs and by -11.5% in local currencies; H2 sales decrease by -11.3% in local currenciesDecline in sales mainly due to softness in the instrument business with biopharmaceutical companies globally and general market weakness in ChinaAdjusted EBITDA of CHF 164.4 million (2023: CHF 220.6 million), adjusted EBITDA margin reached 17.6% (2023: 20.5%)Margins declined due to lower sales volume, but were partly offset by cost-reduction measuresAdjusted net profit of CHF\u00a0103.1 million (2023: CHF\u00a0164.4 million), adjusted earnings per share of CHF\u00a08.08 (2023: CHF\u00a012.88)Proposal for a stable dividend of CHF 3.00 per share Operating cash flow of CHF 148.5 million (2023: CHF 160.6 million), cash conversion increased to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%) Tecan reports 2024 financial results, enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions In 2024, reduced spending in the biopharmaceutical industry led to decreased demand for life science research instruments, affecting both the Life Sciences Business and the Partnering Business. Additionally, a general market weakness in China impacted both direct sales and indirect business through global OEM customers. In the Partnering Business, sales were further influenced by specific customer-related factors, including normalized demand patterns following inventory replenishment by a key customer in 2023. As a result, reported sales for the Group in fiscal year 2024 decreased by 13.0% in Swiss francs, totaling CHF 934.3 million (2023: CHF 1,074.4 million). In local currencies, sales were 11.5% below the prior-year period, aligning with the revised sales outlook from October 2024, which anticipated a decline of 12-14%. Sales in the second half decreased by 12.3% in Swiss francs and by 11.3% in local currencies compared to the prior-year period. These sales results were previously communicated in a trading statement on January 8, 2025. The Annual General Meeting of Tecan's shareholders will take place on April 10, 2025A Q1 2025 Qualitative Update will be published on May 12, 2025The 2025 Interim Report will be published on August 12, 2025A Q3 2025 Qualitative Update will be published on October 13, 2025 1 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 16.4 million) Innovation and product launches in the Life Sciences Business Tecan's 2024 Sustainability Report, published as part of the Annual Report, includes a Climate Risk Scenarios Analysis, highlighting the company's proactive approach to addressing transition and physical risks related to climate change. In preparation for the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Tecan has integrated related data management into its Finance function. For the first time, Tecan's financial auditors conducted a limited assurance audit of key 2024 environmental and social data points. Further progress was made towards greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, with renewable sources accounting for 87% of all electricity purchased. In 2025, Tecan will continue its pragmatic approach to managing risks and opportunities associated with the company's material topics. Enhancing operational resilience through cost-reduction initiatives, while expanding global operations and commercial reach Driving innovation in the Life Sciences Business with new product launches and digital advancementsFurther strengthening the Partnering Business with new launches and an enriched project pipeline, aiming to double project signings across Synergence, Cavro, and ParamitAdvancing sustainability initiatives with enhanced risk management, external data audit, and increased renewable energy use Full-year order entry was CHF 903.6 million, a decrease of 12.1% compared to CHF 1,028.1 million in 2023, reflecting a 10.5% decline in local currencies. The Partnering Business segment was impacted by a shift in OEM customer ordering patterns, moving from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Meanwhile, the Life Sciences Business segment saw moderate order entry growth in local currencies in the second half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, the Group's order entry in the second half decreased by 11.2% in local currencies. Participants should, if possible, dial in 15 minutes before the start of the event. The overall market environment is showing first signs of stabilization after a significant decline in demand last year, with further improvements expected over the course of 2025. However, new political uncertainties have emerged, including the announced reductions to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research budget in the US, which could further impact demand for life science research instruments. For 2025, Tecan anticipates that the year will begin with continued softer market conditions, with potential improvement as the year progresses. Depending on the extent of this improvement in the second half, the market could turn slightly positive for the full year, driven by specific growth segments, such as the clinical diagnostics market. The dial-in numbers for the conference call are as follows: M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland, March 12, 2025 - The Tecan Group (SIX Swiss Exchange: TECN) today announced its full set of audited financial results for 2024, underscoring its commitment to enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions. The company also initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025. Outlook Financial results for the full year 2024 - Highlights Reported EBIT in this segment (earnings before interest and taxes) reached CHF 39.5 million (2023: CHF 84.4 million). The reported operating profit margin decreased to 9.8% of sales (2023: 18.3%), primarily due to the negative volume effect, which resulted in missing economies of scale. Cost control measures helped alleviate the impact of lower sales volumes and adverse exchange rate effects. The adjusted EBITDA3 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) for this segment was CHF 79.1 million, compared to CHF 105.5 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.6% of sales, compared to 22.9% in 2023. At the 2024 Capital Markets Day, Tecan highlighted its strong Partnering Business relationships and robust project pipeline across its three business lines: Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit. Examples include Tecan's collaboration with Illumina in the Synergence line, supporting their expansion into multi-omics with the development of a new system. Through Paramit, Tecan assisted THINK\u00ae Surgical with the design transfer and initiated the manufacturing of their TMINI\u00ae miniature robotic system, cart, and smart cell charging station. Additionally, Paramit is manufacturing the Avive Connect AED, an innovative and user-friendly automated external defibrillator aimed at improving survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest. Key upcoming dates Reported EBIT amounted to CHF\u00a046.6 million (2023: CHF\u00a064.4 million), while the reported operating profit margin reached 8.7% of sales (2023: 10.3%). Similar to the Life Sciences Business segment, lower sales volumes and the resulting negative economies of scale were the main factors affecting margin development. The pipeline of new development projects has been further enriched through joint selling of Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit services, targeting key customers in the life sciences, lab diagnostics, and Medtech segments. Tecan aims to double new project signings by 2027 through joint selling efforts, a targeted approach, and strategic account management. In the second half of the year, sales declined by 5.0% in local currencies, following the sharp 15.5% decline in the first half. Sequentially, the Life Sciences Business segment grew by 13.6% in local currencies when comparing the second half of 2024 to the first half. Tecan also reiterated its mid-term outlook, in which the company anticipates returning to average organic growth rates in the mid to high single-digit percentage range in local currencies under normal market conditions, while continuously improving profitability. In 2024, Tecan demonstrated its commitment to agile cost management amid evolving economic conditions and revenue trends by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and optimizing its global organizational footprint. These efforts are designed to protect profitability without limiting the company's growth potential. As a result, Tecan forecasts an adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding restructuring, acquisition- and integration-related costs, of 17.5-18.5% of sales. Tecan will hold an analyst and media conference to discuss the 2024 annual results today at 09:00 (CET). The presentation will also be relayed by live audio webcast, which interested parties can access at www.tecan.com under Investor Relations. A link to the webcast will be provided immediately prior to the event. 2 The calculation of 2024 adjusted net profit and adjusted earnings per share excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 16.4 million) and accumulated amortization of acquired intangible assets (+CHF 19.0 million) and they were calculated with the reported Group tax rate of 13.6%.

This new entity includes team members with over 20 years of experience working with Tecan, bringing valuable local market knowledge to better serve this growing market. Further building on sustainability activities Tecan CEO Dr. Achim von Leoprechting commented: \"Tecan is navigating a challenging market environment marked by reduced spending in our target markets, leading to lower demand in both the Life Sciences and Partnering Business segments. These challenges have been compounded by general market weakness in China and specific customer-related factors. In response, we have implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program and optimized our global operations to reinforce our leading position. The long-term trends in healthcare remain unchanged: from life science research to clinical applications, automation and innovation are crucial for scaling healthcare solutions in research, clinical diagnostics, and medtech. This is especially important amid rising healthcare costs, ultimately benefiting people worldwide.

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has threatened Mexico with tariffs in a bid to extract greater efforts to fight fentanyl trafficking. He designated Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations and his Attorney General Pam Bondi reorganized the Justice Department in order to pursue Trump\u2019s goal of the \u201ctotal elimination\u201d of the groups. The new order from the Treasury, which will take effect 30 days after it is published in the Federal Register, did not specify what type of transactions are under particular scrutiny by authorities. Such money service businesses change currencies, cash checks, sell pre-paid services and send international money wires or remittances. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the order was part of the administration\u2019s efforts to combat risks that drug cartels present to the US financial system. The amplified powers of prosecutors enabled by the designation of cartels as terrorist organizations has created higher risks for companies that facilitate payments to the gangs.", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-tariffs-spark-trade-34844502": "The EU vowed today to respond with a series of its own measures this morning, as has Canada, while the UK is so far taking the tariff impact on its chin. The Government has been urged to act as the tariffs hit British steel, but an expert has warned that doing so could doubly harm the economy when it is already in a fragile state. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters this morning the bloc was hoping to \"explore better solutions with the US\" after ordering $28 billion (\u00a321.6 billion) tariffs on US goods from next month. She said: \"We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geoeconomic and political uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with such tariffs.\" Donald Trump's trade war came to Europe this morning as the deal-seeking US President activated his 25 percent steel and aluminium tariffs - further destabilising the global economy. Mr Trump's tariffs have been strapped to all US imports, meaning British steel hasn't been spared from the order despite the seemingly positive relationship shared by the President and PM Keir Starmer. The UK steel industry is a relatively small proportion of the country's GDP, contributing around \u00a32billion to the UK economy in 2020 and representing around 0.1 percent of total economic output. Dr Foucart said the affected nations would likely take a specific message from the experience and ensure global production is not too dependant on a single financial partner. He said: \"The main message every country will take home from this is that our production cannot be too dependent from inputs from a single partner. He said: \"The UK\u2019s response must include delivering a robust Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the strongest possible trade defence measures to shield our sector from diverted imports. At a minimum we must at least match any measures taken by the EU. The sizeable new tariffs, seen as a bid to by the Commander-in-Chief to reorder trade in his favour, are the latest in a series of border-hopping punitive financial measures designed by Trump to redress so-called \"bad deals\". He believes the US is ultimately losing out on the world's stage, and is now aiming to renegotiate and renege - but has come under fire from allies he has targeted. Steel exports make up a much larger proportion of Ukraine's economy, making up 14.6 percent of exports and 5.7 percent of the country's total GDP. In 2023, figures showed that steel made up 57.9 percent of the country's exports to the US, suggesting it will suffer from Trump's latest orders. Alasdair McDiarmid, the Assistant General Secretary for steelworker's union Community, said the tariffs will prove \"hugely damaging\" and threaten jobs, adding it would also blow back on the US. He said: \"These US tariffs on UK steel exports are hugely damaging and they threaten jobs. For the US it\u2019s also self-defeating, as the UK is a leading supplier of specialist steel products required by their defence and aerospace sectors.\" He said: \"Manufacturing today is based on deeply interconnected supply chains. This means that any tariff on material such as steel or aluminium makes production more expensive for everyone. For instance, if a US car manufacturer needs to pay 25 percent more to buy steel, this will reflect immediately on the price of cars.\" He said: \"While the EU and Canada seem to go for the 'retaliation' approach, adding their own counter measures to the US import taxes (tariffs), the UK may choose to try to weather the storm. Retaliation hurts your economy again: your exporters struggle due to US import taxes, and your own consumers and producers struggle due to domestic import taxes. While the costs are mounting for the country in the middle of a fight for its life, Dr Foucart said the most significant impact would be the ongoing western trade war. He said: \"I would say the main impact is that trade wars between Western partners (the EU, Canada, the US) play in the hands of Russia, by making us all poorer and less united. And perhaps less focused on our joint support for Ukraine.\" Canada has emerged as one of Mr Trump's chief targets during his latest terms, with the US President seemingly keen to have the nation become the \"treasured\" 51st state. He has independently levelled and rescinded tariffs on his country's vital trade partner neighbour, from which it imports the most steel. The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on US industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to 25 percent. The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the US tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. \"But they have an advantage: they seem to help Trump find his senses, as evidence by the flurry of announcements and cancellation of tariffs.\" Those nations stand to lose the most financially, especially Mexico, for which steel exports to the US are worth the most - around $4.3 billion (\u00a33.3 billion). Other nations, namely the EU, while exporting less, have decried Mr Trump's move as damaging for global trade and international relations. Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister of Australia, said the tariffs went \"against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship\". Australia will not level tit-for-tat duties, but said those imposed on his country were \"a form of economic self-harm, and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation\". Canadian leaders have repeatedly against tariffs coming from the US, any of which would prove nationally devastating thanks to the country's massive economic stakes. The US is Canada's largest trading partner, with the World Integrated Trade Solution estimating a huge 76.8 per cent share of its international exports going south of the border in 2022. Many countries hit by the tariffs have resolved to respond with rounds of their own against the US, and representatives for Brit workers have advised the UK government to do the same. Mr McDiarmid recommended the UK should respond with appropriate \"defence measures\", including \"at the very least\", matching the tariffs. In 2013, the UK produced 5.6million tonnes of steel, a tiny 0.3 percent of the global total. While the proportion of trade is low, the industry is spread across around 1,100 UK businesses, which support 40,000 jobs. These are expected to be directly threatened by the tariffs. The latest round of tariffs - which were imposed the night before the global steel tariffs activated - were ordered on steel and aluminium, with an additional 25 percent added to the existing 25 percent rate, bringing it to 50 percent. The move was a reaction to previously Trump-supporting Ontario governor Doug Ford's move to respond to Mr Trump with a 25 percent tariff on electricity from his state. \"This is what Europe is trying to do by \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China. And China by trying to reduce its dependency on exporting to the US. This implies we do not always choose the cheaper product but also think in terms of economic autonomy. Higher prices for everyone, but higher resilience also.\" EU members Germany, Ireland and Italy, all of which have a trade surplus with the US, are anticipating the most significant impact from the tariffs. In 2023, Germany's surplus was worth \u20ac57 billion (\u00a347.9 billion), with Ireland's worth \u20ac50 billion (\u00a342.1 billion) and Italy's \u20ac41 billion (\u00a334.5 billion). \"We\u2019re incredibly disappointed that the US has decided to take this course of action and we will continue to work with steel companies and the UK Government to deliver the best possible outcome for our members and our industry.\" But Dr Foucart warned that retaliatory measures may doubly hurt the economy, hitting both exporters and consumers. He added the overarching trade wars would have a \"bad\" impact, saying price increases across the supply chain would mean \"we will all suffer\". The EU duties aim for pressure points in the US while minimizing additional damage to Europe. The tariffs - taxes on imports - primarily target Republican-held states, hitting soybeans in House speaker Mike Johnson's Louisiana, but also beef and poultry in Kansas and Nebraska. Produce in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia is also on the list. Get email updates with the day's biggest stories The Ukrainian Steel Association warned in February, weeks before the tariffs came into effect, that import duties could cost the war-weary industry about 2.4billion hryvnias (\u00a342.7million) in revenue and the government 1billion hryvnias (\u00a317.7million) in taxes per year. The US imports more steel from Canada than any other country, according to the US Department of Commerce, having received six million tonnes from its immediate neighbour in 2024. Brazil and Mexico, the other US neighbour, come in second and third on the tariff table, exporting 4.1 and 3.2 milion tonnes to the country respectively. Dr Renaud Foucart, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Lancaster, told the Mirror UK manufacturing - which represents nearly 20 percent of the UK's GDP - would become more expensive.", "https://www.fxstreet.com/news/usd-chf-strengthens-to-near-08850-ahead-of-us-cpi-inflation-release-202503120535": " Gold prices accelerate their weekly recovery and flirt with the key $2,940 mark per troy ounce on Wednesday on the back of the lack of direction in the Greenback, tariff concerns and cooling US inflation. The generalised optimism in the risk-linked universe coupled with the irresolute price action in the Greenback bolsters the move higher in GBP/USD, which re-shifts its attention to the 1.3000 threshold.

The USD/CHF pair trades in positive territory for the third consecutive day near 0.8840 during the early European session on Wednesday. The uptick of the pair is bolstered by the renewed US Dollar (USD) demand. Traders will keep an eye on the US February Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data, which is due later on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index (DXY),\u00a0a measure of the USD's value relative to its most significant trading partners' currencies, rebounds to around 103.60 after bouncing off the multi-month lows near 103.20. Nonetheless, the Greenback faces some headwinds amid\u00a0concerns mounted over a US slowdown and the impact of tariffs on global economic growth.Market players will take more cues from the US CPI release on Wednesday. The headline CPI is expected to show an increase of 0.3% MoM in February. On an annual basis, headline inflation is forecast to show an increase of 2.9%, while core CPI is estimated to show a rise of 3.2% during the same reported period.Houthi spokesman said late Tuesday that they will attack any Israeli ship that violates the group's ban on Israeli ships passing through the Red and Arabian Seas, the Bab al-Mandab Strait, and the Gulf of Aden, effective immediately. Heightened safe-haven demand amid growing concerns over global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could boost the Swiss Franc (CHF) and create a headwind for USD/CHF. The Swiss Franc (CHF) is considered a safe-haven asset, or a currency that investors tend to buy in times of market stress. This is due to the perceived status of Switzerland in the world: a stable economy, a strong export sector, big central bank reserves or a longstanding political stance towards neutrality in global conflicts make the country\u2019s currency a good choice for investors fleeing from risks. Turbulent times are likely to strengthen CHF value against other currencies that are seen as more risky to invest in. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) meets four times a year \u2013 once every quarter, less than other major central banks \u2013 to decide on monetary policy. The bank aims for an annual inflation rate of less than 2%. When inflation is above target or forecasted to be above target in the foreseeable future, the bank will attempt to tame price growth by raising its policy rate. Higher interest rates are generally positive for the Swiss Franc (CHF) as they lead to higher yields, making the country a more attractive place for investors. On the contrary, lower interest rates tend to weaken CHF. Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

As a small and open economy, Switzerland is heavily dependent on the health of the neighboring Eurozone economies. The broader European Union is Switzerland\u2019s main economic partner and a key political ally, so macroeconomic and monetary policy stability in the Eurozone is essential for Switzerland and, thus, for the Swiss Franc (CHF). With such dependency, some models suggest that the correlation between the fortunes of the Euro (EUR) and the CHF is more than 90%, or close to perfect. \u00a92025 \"FXStreet\" All Rights Reserved SPONSORED Discover the top brokers for trading EUR/USD in 2025.

The Swiss Franc (CHF) is Switzerland\u2019s official currency. It is among the top ten most traded currencies globally, reaching volumes that well exceed the size of the Swiss economy. Its value is determined by the broad market sentiment, the country\u2019s economic health or action taken by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), among other factors. Between 2011 and 2015, the Swiss Franc was pegged to the Euro (EUR). The peg was abruptly removed, resulting in a more than 20% increase in the Franc\u2019s value, causing a turmoil in markets. Even though the peg isn\u2019t in force anymore, CHF fortunes tend to be highly correlated with the Euro ones due to the high dependency of the Swiss economy on the neighboring Eurozone.

Macroeconomic data releases in Switzerland are key to assessing the state of the economy and can impact the Swiss Franc\u2019s (CHF) valuation. The Swiss economy is broadly stable, but any sudden change in economic growth, inflation, current account or the central bank\u2019s currency reserves have the potential to trigger moves in CHF. Generally, high economic growth, low unemployment and high confidence are good for CHF. Conversely, if economic data points to weakening momentum, CHF is likely to depreciate.

Yesterday (Tuesday), USD fell slightly below 7.2260 (low of 7.2250). While there has been no significant increase in downward momentum, USD could potentially drop to 7.2000. We will hold the same view, provided that the \u2018strong resistance\u2019 at 7.2650 (level previously at 7.2800) is not breached.\" The author and FXStreet are not registered investment advisors and nothing in this article is intended to be investment advice. The generalised optimism in the risk-linked universe coupled with the irresolute price action in the Greenback bolsters the move higher in GBP/USD, which re-shifts its attention to the 1.3000 threshold.

Yesterday, we highlighted that 'despite the advance, there has been no significant increase in momentum, and instead of continuing to rise, USD is more likely to trade in a 7.2400/7.2700 range.' Instead of trading in a range, USD fell, reaching a low of 7.2250 in late NY trade. The sharp drop appears to be overdone, and while USD could recover today, as long as 7.2500 is not breached, there is potential for further downside toward 7.2200 before stabilization can be expected. The major support at 7.2000 is unlikely to come into view today.\" EUR/USD still cannot capitalise on the US Dollar's inconclusive price action, retreating modestly to the 1.0900 neighbourhood as market participants continue to adjust to the lower-than-expected US inflation data in February. Bitcoin (BTC), XRP and Solana (SOL) prices struggle on Wednesday. The three tokens rank in the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and the risk-off sentiment in the crypto market has ushered in a cooling-off period.
