A day before Trump’s tariffs are set to take effect, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks will soon introduce a measure that would use Congress’ power to overrule the White House on trade policy. Schumer also pushed back on the GOP’s argument that a majority of Americans voted for President Donald Trump and for his platform, which included the tariff policies he has undertaken. The full implications of the ruling are not clear given that a federal judge in Maryland earlier this month issued a preliminary injunction that reinstated some of the employees not covered in the case before the Supreme Court. Vance, who was recently named the RNC’s finance chair in an unprecedented move, attended a luncheon in Houston and will attend a dinner in Dallas that cost attendees anywhere from $25,000 per couple to $250,000 for co-chairs, per the invitations. More context: Trump has repeatedly said that the US runs a $350 billion deficit in goods trade with the EU. Although there is a large discrepancy between the deficit figures cited by the EU and US because of the different ways they are calculated, neither figure is anywhere near as large as what Trump has claimed. At 12:01 EDT tonight, Canada’s counter-tariffs will come into force.There will be 25% tariffs on all non-CUSMA-compliant vehicles from the U.S., and 25% tariffs on the contents of CUSMA-compliant vehicles that are not from Canada or Mexico.President Trump caused this trade… He told reporters today that he is working with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and that lawmakers from both chambers will be “out there talking to the people during the recess all the time, on the issue of tariffs, on the issue of Medicaid, on the issue of taxes, on the issue of social security.” Several law firms have made agreements with the Trump administration that they will provide pro bono legal services throughout the president’s second term, including Skadden Arps, Milbank and Willkie Farr. More context: China was America’s second largest source of imports last year, shipping a total of $439 billion worth of goods to the US while the US exported $144 billion worth of goods to China. The mutual tariffs threaten to hurt domestic industries and are poised to result in layoffs. The prison has the capacity to hold 40,000 inmates. Prison director Belarmino Garcia told CNN they’re “approaching capacity” but there is still room for many more inmates, without citing specifics. US stocks mostly fell after an extremely volatile day yesterday — tumbling, surging and then bouncing around in every direction, as traders searched for any sign that Trump’s tariffs could be negotiated or halted. Justice Department attorney Jessica Dillon countered that the logic of a Supreme Court’s ruling last week siding with the administration over the termination of Department of Education grants also applied in this case. The department said in a news release today that the DOJ terminated federal grants for three programs: one meant to address substance abuse disorder and recovery for those leaving the prison system, one meant to assist incarcerated parents with minor children and another meant to improve probation supervision outcomes. US stock futures were also higher. The Dow index was on track to open 1.8% up and the S&P 500 index 1.6% higher. For the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, futures pointed to a 1.6% rise at the open. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that talks with Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will be indirect, Iran’s semi-official media outlet Tasnim News reported earlier Tuesday. Oman would mediate the talks, according to Tasnim. From CNN’s Elise Hammond, Alejandra Jaramillo, Chris Isidore, Nectar Gan, Kevin Liptak, Elisabeth Buchwald, Yong Xiong, John Towfighi, David Goldman, Matt Egan, Max Saltman, Bryan Mena and Paula Newton. Dozens of US service members who rejoined the military after being discharged over their refusal to get vaccinated against Covid-19, but before a new Pentagon policy took effect earlier this year, will not receive backpay like their counterparts who are rejoining now. Trump announced them while seated next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office yesterday. The sudden revelation appeared to surprise Netanyahu, with a smile quickly vanishing from his face as he looked toward his team of advisers. It’s unclear if Netanyahu was given an advance notice or if he was consulted ahead of time, the sources said. Keep in mind: The decision is not the final word on whether the employees will be allowed to keep their jobs, but it will have a significant impact on both the workers and the agencies in the meantime. President Donald Trump said he had a “great call” with South Korea’s acting president this morning, noting that they have the “confines” of a deal for both countries and that a negotiating team is on its way to the US. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said the administration is managing “a massive number of requests for negotiations” from nations to avoid having “reciprocal” tariffs levied on them starting at 12:01 a.m. ET. Wednesday. “These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs. Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue,” Leavitt said in response to a question about the back-and-forth from CNN’s Alayna Treene today. Trump did say Monday he’s open to trade talks with powers like Japan and Israel. The prospect of nascent negotiations meant there was no repeat of gargantuan losses of last week on US markets. The Russian delegation will be led by Russian Ambassador to the US Alexander Darchiev and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Russia and Central Europe, Sonata Coulter, state media TASS reported on Tuesday, citing the foreign ministry. White House staff secretary Will Scharf said one action directs all department and agencies to “end all discriminatory policies against the coal industry,” including getting rid of a measure that previously prevented coal projects on federal land. The Democratic leader noted that he had signed on as a co-sponsor of Sen. Ron Wyden’s resolution to roll back global tariffs, and reiterated that Democrats will force a vote on it after the recess. CNN’s David Goldman, John Towfighi and Matt Egan contributed reporting to this post. “From now on we’ll ensure that our nation’s critically needed coal plants, as an example, remain online and fully operational. They’re always going to be operational,” Trump said at an executive order signing ceremony today. “And again, we’re going to have guarantees that government cannot close them down — close you down and destroy your lives.” On Monday, US President Donald Trump said the EU must buy around $350 billion worth of American LNG to compensate for the deficit the US has in goods trade with the bloc. The lawsuit comes hours after the Supreme Court lifted a temporary restraining order challenging President Donald Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives the administration tremendous authority to target and speed up deportations of alleged gang members. “We are gratified by the court’s decision. Today’s ruling affirms the fundamental right of the press and public to speak freely without government retaliation. This is a freedom guaranteed for all Americans in the U.S. Constitution. We look forward to continuing to provide factual, nonpartisan and independent coverage of the White House for billions of people around the world,” the statement read. The White House’s decision to punish the Associated Press by eliminating its access to President Donald Trump’s events, the Oval Office and Air Force One is unconstitutional, a federal judge said today. “Mr. Colby’s confirmation leaves open the door for the less-polished standard-bearers of restraint and retrenchment at the Pentagon to do irreparable damage to the system of alliances and partnerships which serve as force multipliers to U.S. leadership,” the Kentucky Republican said. “It encourages isolationist perversions of peace through strength to continue apace at the highest levels of Administration policymaking.” Most Asian stock indexes closed higher: If it is indeed privileged, as both parties expect, the vote must come up within 15 days. Krause’s decision to accept the agency’s deferred resignation offer comes on the heels of the IRS and Department of Homeland Security finalizing an agreement yesterday to provide sensitive taxpayer data to federal immigration authorities to help the Trump administration locate and deport undocumented immigrants. Bradley Girard, an attorney with the Democracy Forward Foundation representing the plaintiffs, argued that the court had the power to weigh in now because the lawsuit contested the “wholesale termination” of the grant program. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump “absolutely” thinks technology like iPhones could move production to the US. America was the bloc’s biggest supplier of LNG in 2024, representing a 45% share of those imports, according to the commission. “It was an administrative error as to why he was deported, and he is a known gang member,” the attorney general said. “ICE testified he was a gang member, and we believe he should stay where he is.” Dill said about 80 people across the department returned before the new policy was put into place. “That is also something, of course, that we can take a look at, that we have not addressed in this guidance,” he said. The White House said President Donald Trump does imagine products like iPhones could be manufactured in the United States Asked whether Congress should allocate additional funding to the judicial branch to address immigration case backlogs and ensure deportees get due process, Johnson acknowledged that more resources are required “because we have so many people to process” and that “we have to give Customs and Border Patrol agents and everybody involved in the process the resources they need to get the job done.” • Setback for administration: In a blow to the administration, a federal judge ruled today that the White House’s decision to punish the Associated Press by eliminating its access to President Donald Trump’s events, the Oval Office and Air Force One is unconstitutional. President Donald Trump is expected to meet with a group of House Republicans who have expressed opposition in voting for the GOP budget resolution, two sources tell CNN. “The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion. That is all the Court orders today: For the Government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP’s use of disfavored terminology,” McFadden added later. The court’s three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court’s conservative wing, partially dissented. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier that the meeting follows the round of discussions between Moscow and Washington in Istanbul on February 27, which focused on working to ease tensions and restore bilateral contacts. A federal judge today rejected a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups challenging the Trump administration’s suspension of grants for citizenship training programs. After imposing across-the-board 10% tariffs on virtually all products coming into the United States Saturday, the Trump administration is set to impose significantly steeper levies still on dozens of countries. Those tariffs, which Trump has called “reciprocal,” although they are no such thing, amount to as much as 50% for a handful of countries — and some tariffs on China could rise to about 70%. “We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States. Like with South Korea, we are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. ‘ONE STOP SHOPPING’ is a beautiful and efficient process!!!” CNN’s Marshall Cohen contributed reporting to this post which was updated with details on the data-sharing agreement as well as a Treasury statement. Hassett added that Trump “prioritizes two of our closest allies and trading partners: Japan and Korea,” he said in a Tuesday morning Fox News interview. “The word out of those conversations was really positive.” Attorney General Pamela Bondi called Monday’s Supreme Court decision allowing the administration to rapidly deport alleged gang members a “landmark victory for the rule of law.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune acknowledged the conservative House Republicans who are refusing to back the Senate-passed budget blueprint and demanding deeper cuts. Meloni, a fellow right-wing politician, has close ties to Trump and attended his inauguration. CNN previously reported that the House Rules Committee has been told it could meet as early as 7 a.m. ET tomorrow morning to tee up the budget resolution, according to two sources familiar with the plans. CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg contributed reporting. This post has been updated with more reporting on the US tariffs on China. He said he plans to ask US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday about “who’s on point” on trade policy. Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokesperson for the European Commission, told reporters Tuesday: “Half of our LNG already comes from the United States, and we are ready, going forward, to work with Trump administration. We are ready to discuss. We’re ready to negotiate.” Sen. Todd Young, who has also signed onto the bill, told CNN that Congress should “play a meaningful role when it comes to developing revenue measures, whether it’s taxes or tariffs.” Here’s what to know: The administration believes, as Trump said yesterday, that these will be direct talks between the two sides, the source said. The president’s top trade negotiator defended the expansive US tariffs in a Senate hearing today, saying almost 50 countries have approached him to “explore how to achieve reciprocity.” The two leaders will speak about the partnership between the two countries for Trump’s immigration policy and how “El Salvador’s cooperation with the United States has become a model for others to work with this administration,” Leavitt added. Asked if Trump helped change any minds, Johnson answered, “I think he did.” He said he anticipates “moving forward this week.” Trump said he spoke with South Korea about tariffs and military protection. Melanie Krause, acting Internal Revenue Service commissioner, informed her staff today she is leaving the agency amid internal chaos and the exodus of several senior IRS officials, according to two current IRS employees and one former IRS employee. Our live coverage of Donald Trump’s presidency has ended for the day. Follow the latest updates or read through the posts below. Trump also suggested law firms could help secure the “tailored” deals on tariffs he’s seeking. See how Trump’s tariffs could impact Italian goods in both countries: President Donald Trump is set to impose an additional 84% in levies across all Chinese imports tomorrow, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Tuesday. “I had a very good meeting today with the Speaker of the House and some of our more Conservative Members, all great people. I let them know that, I AM FOR MAJOR SPENDING CUTS! WE ARE GOING TO DO REDUCTIONS, hopefully in excess of $1 Trillion Dollars, all of which will go into ‘The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.’ I, along with House Members and Senators, will be pushing very hard to get these large scale Spending Cuts done, but we must get the Bill approved NOW,” the president wrote. Initially, those goods were set to face tariffs of 30% come May 2. But Trump’s latest executive order hiked the rates to 90%. Stock markets around the world rose Tuesday after a major rout the previous day, fueled by fears over the economic fallout of US President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. • Legal win: Earlier, the Supreme Court said that it will allow several thousand probationary federal employees off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether downsizing efforts are legal. The government initially alleged Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was part of the MS-13 gang, but there is not a court case linking him to the group. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that moves to negotiate on tariffs have “nothing to do with the market,” but are the “result of the massive inflow” of calls to President Donald Trump. President Donald Trump will hit China with an additional 84% in levies across all imports, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said today. That will mean all goods from the country will be subject to a tariff of at least 104%. Musk has advocated against the new tariffs, including in public remarks and private conversations with Trump, according to people familiar with the matter. CNN saw prisoners with their hands cuffed behind their backs and lining up as guards searched the cells. He went on to project optimism about a deal. “In any event, we have the confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries,” he wrote. The president’s remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) President’s Dinner in Washington, DC, come after he met with House Speaker Mike Johnson and other House GOP members at the White House to encourage some holdouts to vote for the bill. The big headline from Monday evening was a significant White House victory. The bottom line: This will impact Americans who order from sites like Shein, Temu and AliExpress, likely leading to higher prices of the goods. He added: “Make no mistake: America will not be made great again by those who are content to manage our decline.” Here’s what else happened yesterday: Canadian officials said today that their country’s counter-tariffs on some US vehicles would come into effect just after midnight ET tonight. Still, many of USAID’s humanitarian aid funding remains cut, including all of its remaining contracts for Afghanistan and Yemen aid. CNN had to broadcast from the side of the road because cell signal is jammed in the prison’s immediate surrounding areas. CNN’s Kevin Liptak contributed reporting to this post. “The US threat to escalate tariffs is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US. China will never accept this. If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,” the ministry said. “As we focus on IT modernization and re-organize the agency to better serve the taxpayer, we are also in the midst of breaking down data silos that for too long have stood in the way of identifying waste, fraud, and abuse and bringing criminals to justice. We believe these goals are critical to a more efficient government and safer country,” a Treasury spokesperson said in a statement. “We wish Melanie well on her next endeavor.” More on the ruling: The court allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act while litigation over the act’s use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that going forward, people who are deported should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained. Former Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell voted against confirming Elbridge Colby to be undersecretary of defense for policy, marking yet another nominee of President Donald Trump whom the senior Republican has balked at supporting. The two parties will discuss Iranian denuclearization, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. But in the six years between his immigration hearing and his deportation, Abrego Garcia checked in with immigration officials annually and was never charged with a crime, court records show. After relinquishing his leadership post, McConnell has increasingly bucked Trump and the evolving GOP. He opposed Pete Hegseth for defense secretary; Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence; and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. All were confirmed to their posts. She has presented herself as a potential bridge between Europe and the Trump White House amid ongoing tensions over defense spending and trade. “We’ll use some of those people, some of those great firms — they are great firms, too. They just had a bad moment, but we’re gonna use some of those firms to work with you on your leasing and your other things, and they’ll do a great job,” the president said surrounded by coal workers in the East Room of the White House, where he was signing executive orders related to energy. Sen. Thom Tillis told CNN he’s mostly hearing from businesses in his state and concerns about the “cost of inputs.” On constituent reaction, he said it’s “only beginning to trickle in now. If you think about when the tariffs were implemented, you won’t see these costs for another week or two as things come onshore.” President Donald Trump claimed his global tariff policy is a “war with the world” before backpedaling and saying that it “is not a war at all,” citing the countries that are sending world leaders to the US to negotiate. But Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said talks with Witkoff will be indirect, Iran’s semi-official media outlet Tasnim News reported earlier today. President Donald Trump doesn’t look like he’s going to blink. The agreement between the agencies was one factor that played a role in Krause’s decision to leave, according to one source with knowledge of the situation. The source said that the last draft of the agreement that Krause had been involved with, and had reviewed, was different than the final agreement. Additionally, Trump, in another order, will also instruct the Justice Department to look into state policies that “discriminates against coal,” according to Scharf. President Donald Trump is participating in an executive order signing event to “unleash American energy,” according to the White House. Multiple senior career IRS officials refused to sign the agreement because of grave concerns about its legality, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. This is why Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ultimately ended up being the person who signed the “memorandum of understanding” with DHS, the source said. The US State Department called the previous talks in Istanbul “constructive discussions.” Reiterating that there are no winners in a trade war, the ministry emphasized that “pressure and threats are not the right way to engage with China.” After markets plunged over the course of the past three trading sessions, Wall Street investors were looking for any excuse to catch their breath ahead of another planned tariff escalation at midnight. “Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “The Government offers no other plausible explanation for its treatment of the AP. The Constitution forbids viewpoint discrimination, even in a nonpublic forum like the Oval Office,” McFadden wrote in the 41-page ruling. The House Rules Committee has been told it could meet as early as 7 a.m. ET tomorrow to tee up the budget resolution, according to two sources familiar with the plans. The administration alleges that Abrego Garcia was arrested “in the company of other ranking gang members” and that he was confirmed to be a member of the gang by a “reliable source.” The release comes hours after Attorney General Pamela Bondi told Fox News that the DOJ has “pulled all nonessential funding” from the Maine Department of Corrections over a dispute about a transgender inmate. “SSA’s announcement that they are considering alternative means of identity verification for phone services is a good step, but more clarity is needed about how this will work for older Americans,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP executive vice president, said. On April 1, however the Pentagon established policy for providing backpay to individuals who rejoin the military under new policies from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The Justice Department terminated certain federal grants to its prison system as the Trump administration continues to feud with the state, according to Maine’s Department of Corrections. “President Trump caused this trade crisis — and Canada is responding with purpose and with force,” Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a statement posted on X announcing the tariff’s date. No military parade has been scheduled for June of this year, a White House official told CNN today, despite defense and local officials saying that the early stages of planning have begun. When pressed by CNN’s Alayna Treene as to why the Justice Department believes a mistakenly deported Maryland man with protected legal status should remain in a mega prison in El Salvador, Bondi doubled down on the administration’s original response to the error. CNN’s Morgan Rimmer, Veronica Stracqualursi and Haley Talbot contributed reporting. House Speaker Mike Johnson left the White House meeting with President Donald Trump and House GOP members today on the Senate-passed budget resolution still adamant on moving forward with holding a vote on the measure this week — despite not having enough support from his caucus at present. President Donald Trump criticized “out of control judges” when discussing his mass deportation policies today, accusing them of wanting to bring gang members back to the country. The remarks come after Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CBS “Face the Nation” on Sunday that “the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little- little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America.” He went on to say that he imagines that process would be automated. Pressed further on whether the president has any timeline or deadline he wants trade deals to be made by, Leavitt again reiterated that they won’t be “off-the-rack deals.” His resolution — which is expected to be deemed “privileged,” which means it will come to the floor despite GOP leadership opposition — would end the tariffs announced by the White House on April 2. More on the Garcia Abrego case: The Trump administration has claimed that Abrego Garcia is a “ranking member” of the MS-13 gang. Because the Trump administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organization, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote, the withholding from the immigration court was no longer enforceable. The preliminary injunction issued this afternoon against the White House by US District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, is a major blow to the administration’s efforts to curtail the AP’s access to the president based on news coverage it dislikes. Colby — who served in the Pentagon in the first Trump administration — was confirmed 54-45, with several Democrats voting for his confirmation: Sens. Mark Kelly, Elissa Slotkin and Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. President Donald Trump has just signed a series of executive actions aimed at strengthening the coal industry following remarks at the White House. “So there’s an array of diverse jobs, more traditional manufacturing jobs, as you discussed, but also jobs in advanced technologies. The president is looking at all of those, he wants them to come back home,” Leavitt said. According to the source, USAID restored its funding for WFP programs in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Ecuador and Somalia. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele will visit the White House on Monday, where he and President Donald Trump will discuss the use of the country’s “super max prison for Tren De Aragua and MS-13 gang members,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during today’s briefing. As of this morning, House Republican leaders were still dealing with at least a dozen firm “no” votes and many more undecided. “This is possibly one of the most tightly controlled if not most controlled prisons in the world,” said David Culver, CNN’s senior national correspondent. China’s Commerce Ministry says it “firmly opposes” the additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports threatened by President Donald Trump on Monday, calling it “a mistake upon a mistake.” Trump also threatened to slap an extra 50% tariff on China if the country doesn’t back down from its retaliatory tariffs it announced Friday. China’s Commerce Ministry on Tuesday said the country would “fight to the end” of the trade war and would continue to stand up to Trump. Italy and many other European countries are facing a steep 20% tariff on all goods imported into the US. CNN’s Barbie Nadeau visits an Italian shop to see how products like parma ham and olive oil will be impacted. #italy #us #tariffs #parmaham #prosciutto #oliveoil The ALA is seeking a preliminary injunction that would require the administration to reverse its actions and pause any further steps it may take “to dissolve the agency,” according to the lawsuit. CNN’s Lauren Fox contributing reporting to this post. Another executive action aims to “protect coal plants currently operating,” he said, and another will promote the security and reliability of the power grid. • Midnight tariff deadline: US tariffs on Chinese imports are set to rise to an astounding 104%, while dozens of other countries, as well as the European Union, face a midnight deadline for levies that will range from 11% to 50%. China said it would “fight to the end” of the trade war and continue to stand up to Trump. The Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, which will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members. Here’s the latest on tariffs: Investors are on edge over the imminent imposition of US President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries, along with his threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on China — a move that risks further escalating an already volatile trade war. “The Chinese want to make a deal, they just don’t know how to do it,” she added. She declined to share what, if any, terms Trump would consider to lower tariffs on China. Some background: Navarro dismissed the Tesla founder and top Trump adviser as a “car assembler” in an interview on CNBC after Musk criticized the new tariffs. The trade adviser has insisted Trump’s levies are not a tax increase but a tax cut. Key GOP senators acknowledged the short-term economic disruption of tariffs and expressed hope that negotiations will eventually roll back President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariff policy. Jeremy Lewin, a top USAID official affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency, requested in an email Tuesday that the terminations be rescinded. As CNN reported yesterday, Bessent flew to Mar-a-Lago over the weekend with a message to the president on tariffs: zero in on the endgame. The order also will “accelerate all permitting and funding for new coal projects,” he told Trump. The agreement was signed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Remember: The Supreme Court yesterday allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, handing the White House a significant victory that will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members. Eugenia Yosef and Michael Schwartz contributed reporting. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will meet President Donald Trump next Thursday as world leaders clamor for talks to secure relief from new tariffs, according to a person familiar with the matter. The reversal comes after the WFP warned Monday that the cuts could “amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation.” The United Nations agency said it had received notice from the Trump administration “indicating that funding for emergency food assistance in 14 countries has been terminated.” CNN has reached out to DOGE for comment. Earlier today, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump will sign an executive order to “reinvigorate” coal. Leavitt also confirmed in a social media post that the president’s executive order will seek to tap into coal. They seem to have found one — at least for now. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the White House will let the “public sparring continue” between Elon Musk and the president’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, over the wisdom of Donald Trump’s new tariffs. Iran restarted its nuclear programs after Trump quashed that deal in 2018. A dispute appears to have escalated between two of President Donald Trump’s top advisers over the wisdom of the new tariffs the president has applied to dozens of countries. The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily paused a court-imposed midnight deadline to return Abrego Garcia, agreeing to a request from Trump that will give the justices more time to consider the case. House Speaker Mike Johnson today applauded the decision by the US Supreme Court to allow President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now to carry out his administration’s rapid deportations efforts. President Donald Trump is shortly expected to sign an executive order to “unleash American energy” with a focus on the coal industry. The American Library Association filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration yesterday, prompted by President Donald Trump’s executive order to reduce the staffing and functions of the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Trump has consistently voiced his intention to leverage US coal, along with oil, natural gas and nuclear power. The president has also expressed a broader effort to undo the energy policies implemented by former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The talks “will be devoted to normalizing the work of the embassies,” TASS said. The Social Security Administration is making yet another change to an anti-fraud policy it announced last month that sparked widespread concerns about its impact on senior citizens and people with disabilities. The countermeasure applies a 25% tariff to vehicles not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade agreement, known as USMCA. Young said Trump needs “broad discretion” to enforce “whatever Congress develops and implements,” adding that he’s been working with the administration on enforcing existing tariff laws. He said the White House has “engaged in a dialogue” on tariffs and has been “helpful and responsive,” and “we’re waiting now for more information on their next steps.” CNN’s John Fritze, Devan Cole and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report. The unsigned decision in the case, one of the most closely watched emergency appeals pending at the Supreme Court, lets Trump invoke the 1798 law to speed removals while litigation over the act’s use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that going forward, people who are deported should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained. But he also threatened to raise cumulative tariffs on China to over 100% — a move that could lead to massive price increases for US shoppers for iPhones, computers and toys. He also implied that the America’s erstwhile friends in the European Union were such implacable foes that there can never be a fair deal. Read more about how Trump’s tariff war could end here. The meeting will be closely watched for how willing Trump is to strike a deal not only with Italy but the larger European Union to ease the new duties. The team also witnessed virtual due process hearings inside the prison, where an inmate was set up in front of a monitor in a small room. In a statement on his vote, McConnell criticized Colby’s isolationist views and warned that his confirmation could lead to “irreparable damage” to US alliances. What’s changed? Last month, Social Security said that people would no longer be able to apply for benefits over the phone as the agency worked to minimize fraud. Instead, people would have to apply through the “my Social Security” website, where they could verify their identity, or at a field office. But advocates said eliminating the phone option would be difficult for older Americans and people with disabilities who are not computer-savvy and can’t easily travel to offices. It is unlikely to succeed, given the White House has already warned it would override any potential measure. But Democrats want to force House Republicans to decide whether they’ll back the president or attempt to prevent price hikes. The American Civil Liberties Union filed an emergency lawsuit in federal court today seeking to halt removals under the Alien Enemies Act for people who may be targeted for deportation in New York. Lauren Easton, AP spokesperson, issued the following statement. This post was updated with a statement from the Associated Press. Carney first announced the retaliatory plan last week. “The Department has changed its priorities with respect to discretionary grant funding to focus on, among other things, more directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault, and better coordinating law enforcement efforts at all levels of government,” the notice said. Musk replied to a post on X of the interview, saying that Navarro is “truly a moron.” Later, defending his car company’s made-in-America credentials, Musk wrote that “Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.” The White House insisted today that discussions being held this weekend with Iran will be “direct” despite pushback from Iranian officials that the talks will be indirect. “In business, you always come up with decisions. You create one throat to choke. I’m just trying to figure out who I should compliment or who I should hold accountable,” he said. “We do know that there is something very, very clear and distinct that is on the table that needs to be accomplished,” she said. “The very specific thing that needs to be accomplished, which would make the world a much safer place, is to make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.” Plaintiffs are also asking the court to certify a class action representing all noncitizens in immigration custody who are or will be subject to the presidential proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff would be there. Earlier, a person familiar with the meeting told CNN that Witkoff would lead the US side in the talks. CNN’s John Fritze and Devan Cole contributed reporting. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell more than 3% shortly after opening on Wednesday. “We don’t want them back,” Trump said during an executive order signing at the White House this afternoon.“Can you imagine? You spend all of that time, energy and money on getting them out and then you have a judge that sits there, a local judge who sits there, federal judges, sits there and says, ‘No no, bring them back.’“One was brought back — or they want to bring him back — because he wasn’t a member of Tren De Aragua, he was a member of MS-13, which is just as bad. So they misidentified him, but it sounds to me like he was a member of MS-13. So they want him brought back because he wasn’t treated properly,” the president claimed, referring to Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador on March 15. It denounced Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” as “completely unfounded” and “typical unilateral bullying.” Bruce insisted it is a “meeting,” rather than a negotiation and would not give specifics on the planned discussions. The Supreme Court’s decision blocks a ruling from a lower court judge that required the government to reinstate more than 16,000 probationary employees. The US Agency for International Development reversed course Tuesday and restored several of the World Food Programme’s lifesaving humanitarian aid contracts after canceling them over the weekend, a source told CNN. Remember: Trump’s sweeping tariffs have targeted all US trading partners, and the International Chamber of Commerce has said that’ll raise the risk of global trade tensions spiraling out of control. If that happens, that could send inflation skyrocketing and weaken economic growth. CNN’s Sarah Ferris contributed to this post, which has been updated with details about the House Rules Committee. Coal is a significant contributor to global warming and burning the fuel to create electricity is also bad for human health. A 2023 scientific study found air pollution from coal plants is far more deadly than originally thought. The study, published in the journal Science, found exposure to fine particulate air pollution from coal-fired plants is associated with a mortality risk that is 2.1 times greater than that of particle pollution from other sources. The press secretary said it is one example of Trump’s “willingness to hear from all sides” and that the president has people with “diverse opinions on very diverse issues” in his inner circle. “We do applaud the ruling from the Supreme Court. I think the most important principle that came out of that is that they said you can’t go venue shopping for this. They’re going to return that back to the court in Texas where it belongs. And I think that’s a very important step,” he told reporters during a news conference. “They’re not going to snap their fingers, find a green field site and build a factory,” he added. “But I am sure that the planning has already started in board rooms. I spent the weekend talking to CEOs and investment bankers and that’s exactly what’s happening.” The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Trump administration to keep several thousand probationary federal employees it is attempting to fire off the payroll while lower courts weigh whether the downsizing efforts are legal, another win for the White House in recent days. Read more about the USAID cuts. Tillis, who is up for reelection next year, is a cosponsor of a bipartisan bill meant to reassert congressional authority and rein in the president’s ability to unilaterally level tariffs. Trump has already said he’ll veto it, and Senate Majority Leader Thune has signaled he’s not eager to bring it to the floor. The country’s CECOT mega-prison is considered the largest prison in the Americas, with a capacity of 40,000 inmates. Under a deal between the US and El Salvador, the prison is housing immigrants deported by the US who it says are alleged gang members. The team was unable to visit the deportees from the US in the airplane-hangar-like building that holds them. This is the CNN team’s second visit to the prison, considered the largest in the Americas, and the conditions appear even more crowded than when it first visited in November last year. © 2025 Cable News Network.

Some background: Tehran and Washington have not engaged in direct formal talks since the Obama administration negotiated the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, when Iran gave up most of its nuclear capability in return for better integration into the global economy. “Libraries play an important role in our democracy, from preserving history to providing access to government information, advancing literacy and civic engagement, and offering access to a variety of perspectives,” said ALA President Cindy Hohl in a statement. “These values are worth defending. We will not allow extremists to threaten our democracy by eliminating programs at IMLS and harming the children and communities who rely on libraries and the services and opportunities they provide.” Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday that it was “a great day for justice in America.” “Countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers, are making a mistake,” Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break.” Oman will mediate the talks, according to Tasnim, despite Trump saying yesterday that direct talks between the US and Iran had already begun. The lawsuit says the administration and the new Department of Government Efficiency “gutted” the IMLS, placing all but 12 of its staff on administrative leave, canceling grants the agency provides to libraries and museums across the country and firing all 23 members of the National Museum and Library Services Board. The following week, the agency said it would limit the new policy to those applying for retirement, survivor or family benefits and delay its rollout until mid-April. US stocks opened higher Tuesday, setting the stage for a rebound. The Dow rose 1,360 points, or 3.6%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 3.76%. Here’s what some Republicans are saying: Judge James Boasberg has canceled today’s scheduled hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction against Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations following last night’s Supreme Court ruling. “The Department is evaluating the impacts to services from these funding terminations,” the Maine Department of Corrections said in the news release. “The Department is aware of related public statements by the United States Attorney General, the notice is the only communication that has been received by the Department.” This post has been updated with more of Greer’s testimony. About 100 or more prisoners were held per cell compared to about 80 or so when the team last visited. Musk said over the weekend that he wants to see a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and European Union, breaking with Trump. He has advocated against the new tariffs, including in public remarks and private conversations with the president, according to people familiar with the matter. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee that the Trump administration’s trade concerns will likely not be fixed anytime soon, but stood by President Donald Trump’s tariff actions as a step in the right direction. “Great meeting. The president was very helpful and engaged. And we had a lot of members whose questions were answered,” Johnson told reporters upon returning from the nearly two-hour long meeting. Trump, however, specifically called out China — on which he’s threatened additional tariffs — saying, “China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen!” This post has been updated with more about Witkoff and from the State Department. “Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks,” Musk wrote. President Donald Trump urged House Republican members to “stop grandstanding” and unite to pass the Senate-passed budget resolution this week. The meeting is expected to be at 1 p.m. ET. “We urge the US to immediately correct its erroneous practices, cancel all unilateral tariff measures against China, stop suppressing China in the economic and trade sphere, and resolve differences properly through equal dialogue based on mutual respect,” the statement added. CNN had previously reported that the House Rules Committee has been told it could meet as early as 7 a.m. ET tomorrow to tee up the budget resolution, according to two sources familiar with the plans. “This guidance that we’ve published is specifically focused on service members that return to service under these policies,” Tim Dill, the official performing the duties of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, told reporters on Tuesday. “It is as much an opportunity as it is a test. The ball is in America’s court,” Araghchi said on X yesterday. Trump said yesterday that America’s goods deficit with the EU could “disappear easily and quickly” if the bloc bought more American energy. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday also confirmed that the city is having discussions with the administration about it, a day after the Washington City Paper reported on the plans for a military parade to be held on June 14. Greer’s hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. ET. Later, Wyden told reporters that he believes more Senate Republicans will sign on as co-sponsors or at least vote for his resolution after they speak with their concerned constituents over the recess. GOP Sen. Rand Paul, a tariff critic, has already signed on as a co-sponsor. China was already set to see tariffs increase by 34% on Wednesday as part of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs package. But the president tacked on another 50% after Beijing didn’t back off its promise to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on US goods by noon Tuesday. “Our large and persistent trade deficit has been over 30 years in the making, and it will not be resolved overnight,” Greer told the committee during a routine hearing. “But all of this is in the right direction, particularly as we start to negotiate with these countries.” Several House Republicans blasted the Senate’s budget blueprint that President Donald Trump is pressing them to adopt this week. Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to corral the votes to push it through his chamber and begin to advance the president’s sweeping agenda. “This is a landmark victory for the rule of law, and this is what we’ve been arguing on behalf of President Trump,” she told Fox News from the White House on Tuesday. “Navarro is truly a moron,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns. President Donald Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff will lead the US side in talks over a new nuclear deal with Iran, a person familiar with this weekend’s meeting in Oman confirmed to CNN. “He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it,” she said, pointing to Apple’s planned investments. Apple said in February that it would put $500 billion into expanding US facilities over the next four years, a move that could help it avoid new tariffs on goods imported from China. “We have a deficit of trust sometimes between the two chambers. But I think when the White House and the president himself expresses his resolve for this and if we hear that from the leader over there — Leader (John) Thune — and all of our colleagues and friends there, that we take it in good faith. That we’re going to do this together in a collaborative effort to deliver this agenda,” he said. The European Union is prepared to negotiate with the United States over buying more of its liquefied natural gas, according to the bloc’s executive arm. Across Europe: Johnson left the White House meeting still adamant on moving forward with holding a vote on the measure this week — despite not having enough support from his conference at present. That date is both the 250th anniversary of the establishment of the US Army and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday. President Donald Trump has instructed his trade team to make “tailor-made” trade deals with countries that want to negotiate following the president’s global tariff policy announcement last week, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Ratepayers in Louisiana and Indiana have footed around $340 million per state in additional costs to keep massive coal plants running in their states, while residents in Interior Sec. Doug Burgum’s home state of North Dakota have had to pay $120 million in additional costs. North Dakota, Indiana and Louisiana have had to pay more than other states in the central US because coal plants are more frequently used to generate power there. Later, defending Tesla’s Made-in-America credentials, Musk wrote that “Tesla has the most American-made cars.” Republican senators who are supporting the bipartisan effort to rein in President Donald Trump’s tariff powers said today that they think Congress should be able to hold the administration accountable. At the end of a nearly two-hour hearing in Maryland, District Judge Lydia Griggsby — a President Joe Biden nominee — said she did not have the authority to intervene in the dispute over the freezing of funds and believed that the Trump administration was likely to prevail on the merits of its argument that it had the discretion to pause those grants. The Kremlin spokesperson said at a press briefing today that Russia would continue conducting the negotiations through its foreign ministry, adding that further updates would be provided by the ministry. Leavitt also confirmed that Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will visit the White House next Thursday. US tariffs on Chinese imports are set to rise to an astounding 104% at midnight ET while dozens of other countries as well as the European Union face tariffs that will range from 11% to 50%. Other independent analyses from think tank Energy Innovation found nearly all US coal plants are more expensive to run than if they were shut down and replaced by renewables and battery storage. Coal has gotten far more expensive as the cost of wind, solar and batteries have come down significantly — aided by tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – publicly dissented. Earlier this year, Trump imposed a ban on the AP to punish the news organization over its decision to continue using the phrase “Gulf of Mexico” even though Trump renamed the body of water “Gulf of America.” AARP has been advocating with Social Security to better accommodate senior citizens. Krause learned about the details of the final agreement from the news, the source said. The bloc had “learned (its) lesson,” she said, from its experience having to rapidly replace its imports of Russian piped natural gas and oil following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The EU has ramped up its imports of American LNG to help plug that gap. Correction: An earlier version of this post provided the wrong locations for today’s luncheon and dinner. Meantime, so-called reciprocal tariffs are also set to go into effect on about 60 other countries. The president has instructed his trade team to make “tailor-made” deals with leaders who want to negotiate, Leavitt said. However, in addition to being the most polluting form of fossil fuel, generating electricity from coal-fired power plants significantly drives up consumer costs. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said today that Democrats are going to focus on concerns over tariffs and potential cuts to Medicaid in their messaging over the Senate recess. As it stands, packages under $800 have been exempt from tariffs through the so-called “de minimus” exemption. A Russian foreign ministry delegation will hold planned talks with the United States on Thursday in Istanbul, Turkey, according to the Kremlin. The ACLU filed the lawsuit and temporary restriction order with the court challenging the use of the act to remove Venezuelan nationals, saying its use is unlawful, exceeds statutory authority, denies people of the right to due process, and violates immigration laws and protections for asylum seekers. “Negotiations are the result of the massive inflow of inbound calls to come and negotiate; it had nothing to do with the market,” Bessent told CNBC, noting that 70 countries have reached out to open tariff talks with the US. “When it comes to Saturday, I won’t get ahead of the president,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing with reporters. “He has said there will be direct talks with Iran on Saturday, I won’t further any details from this podium for obvious reasons, security reasons. We’ll provide an update as we always have,” she said when asked about the nature of the talks. The president went on to highlight why he believes coal plants are beneficial, pointing to their nonstop run times and abundant availability. Greer is expected to further say that the president’s “strategy is already bearing fruit” and that nearly “50 countries have approached me to discuss the President’s new policy and explore how to achieve reciprocity.” Starting on April 14, Social Security will conduct an anti-fraud check on all telephone applications for benefits and flag claims that could be fraudulent, the agency announced today. Those who are flagged must verify their identity in person. Along with increasing China’s overall tariff rate, President Donald Trump signed an executive order tonight tripling tariffs on goods worth less than $800 from the country. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects businesses will take a wait-and-see attitude to find out how trade negotiations between the United States and its trading partners play out before they make any decision on building new plants in America. But he said they are preparing to make such a move. Japan was the top-fifth source of foreign goods shipped to the United States last year, while South Korea was the seventh, according to federal trade data. President Donald Trump’s US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is expected to defend the administration’s tariffs in remarks before the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing this morning. “I think right now, in some ways, we’re speaking slightly different languages, because the House and Senate operate in such different ways. But at the end of the day, what this does is it unlocks budget reconciliation, and it unleashes all the things that we want to accomplish on behalf of the American people, and that can only happen when the House and the Senate pass the same budget resolution,” Thune said. Some background: The Defense Department rescinded the requirement to get vaccinated in 2023, and troops have been able to rejoin the military since. Very few of the more than 8,000 troops who were discharged rejoined. It’s unclear how many people have shown interest thus far in rejoining the military, since President Donald Trump directed the Pentagon to begin forming policy around their return in an executive order in January. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had “a great call with the Acting President of South Korea.” On Monday, Trump also spoke with Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who will be sending a team to visit Washington to negotiate a trade deal. According to a copy of the “Notice of Termination” DOJ sent to the Maine’s Corrections Department, the awards were terminated because they “no longer effectuate Department priorities.” “The Court merely declares that the AP’s exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the Government from continuing down that unlawful path.” According to court filings, Congress has appropriated tens of millions of dollars annually for citizenship training programs, with a total of $155 million allocated since 2009. The programs help immigrants complete naturalization applications, offer English language instruction and provide civics education. As CNN has previously reported, two defense officials said the Trump administration is in the early stages of planning for a military parade to take place in Washington, DC, in June to commemorate the Army’s 250th anniversary. “Business leaders have substantial lead time,” Bessent said in an interview on CNBC this morning. “I’m sure that they are putting together plans for what they would like to do when we finish these negotiations.” House hardliners have raised major alarms at changes made by the Senate GOP, pointing to how senators watered down provisions seeking deeper spending cuts. Johnson can only afford to lose three House GOP votes this week and far more are warning they plan to oppose the plan. This reported has been updated with additional comments from GOP senators. As part of the deal, the IRS agreed to turn over information about undocumented immigrants that DHS says are already facing deportation orders and are under federal criminal investigation, according to the filings. One analysis from Grid Strategies and the Natural Resources Defense Council found that running coal-fired power plants in the central US has collectively cost ratepayers there over $1 billion in excess electricity costs over the course of just three years. Four contracts supporting the work of the International Organization for Migration in the Pacific region were also restored, the source said. “Last Wednesday, President Trump declared a national emergency in response to the large and persistent trade deficit that has built up in recent years,” Greer said, according to a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by CNN. “This deficit is driven in part by non-reciprocal tariffs, trading barriers, and other economic policies pursued by our foreign trading partners. President Trump imposed tariffs to address this emergency.” CNN reported Monday that House Speaker Mike Johnson, facing significant work ahead of him to garner enough support for the Senate’s budget blueprint, is meeting with holdouts and stressing the need for urgency at this stage of the process. He threatened weekend work if the House can’t get the budget passed by Thursday. Here’s what they are saying: The Nikkei 225, which tracks more than 200 of Japan’s biggest listed companies, closed 6% higher on Tuesday, following a nearly 8% plunge on Monday. President Donald Trump has promised his tariff plan will create a manufacturing boom in the United States. But Bessent acknowledged that won’t happen overnight. There were other reasons Krause wanted to leave, the source said, including the direction the agency was going in and the exodus of multiple senior executive career employees within the last few days. Dill added that there is not currently a way for service members who rejoined after the policy was rescinded in 2023 “to put in for the same calculations that we’re doing for those who would return today.” The Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security finalized an agreement Monday to provide sensitive taxpayer data to federal immigration authorities, according to court filings. President Donald Trump today said he signed an executive order aimed at strengthening the US power grid “by ensuring that coal-fired power plants are always available to meet surging demand for electricity.” “If the United States implements the escalating tariff measures, China will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social today that he had a “very good meeting” with House Speaker Mike Johnson and “some of our more Conservative Members” ahead of the House vote on the Senate-passed budget resolution this week. “I do think that the war with the world, which is not a war at all because they’re all coming here. Japan is coming here as we speak. They’re in a plane flying, lots of them. All tough negotiators,” the president said tonight at the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) President’s Dinner in Washington, DC. Itkonen also said the EU intends to keep its “energy sources diverse” to avoid becoming too dependent on any one supplier. Trump added later that countries are calling him up and “kissing my a**” to try and make a trade deal. “The entire administration has always said that President Trump is willing to pick up the phone and talk. And the president met with his trade team this morning, and he directed them to have tailor-made trade deals with each and every country that calls up this administration to strike a deal,” Leavitt told reporters at the White House press briefing. A senior House Democrat is planning to force a vote to terminate President Donald Trump’s steep global tariffs that have rattled American consumers and could soon raise the prices of everything from groceries to gasoline, according to a person familiar with the plans. Vice President JD Vance is participating today in two fundraisers for the Republican National Committee, according to invitations for the events obtained exclusively by CNN. “We were having a discussion last night about which countries to prioritize, and I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very quickly,” Bessent said. “If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals,” he added, noting the president will be personally involved in negotiations. The lawsuit, filed by Democracy Forward on behalf of the ALA and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, describes the administration’s cuts as “unlawful” and a step to “dismantle” the IMLS. She also said the president is “also looking at advanced technologies,” such as artificial intelligence and other “emerging fields.” “It’s a habeas hearing in the court of confinement, which means in Texas, so it will be a much faster hearing. They can’t do class actions. It will be a much smoother, simpler hearing and these people will be deported,” Bondi said. Israeli reaction: The talks are “certainly not” to Israel’s liking, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. “Sorry for all the back and forth on awards,” he wrote in the email, which was seen by CNN. “There are a lot of stakeholders and we need to do better about balancing these competing interests – that’s my fault and I take responsibility.” But they were able to visit another part of the prison — the same that they visited in November last year — and Culver says the number of inmates appears to have grown since then. President Donald Trump suggested today that he will call on law firms that have made agreements with the White House to help with coal production and tariff deals. “I went down to see President Trump, as I do many weekends, and I can tell you, it’s all President Trump’s decision. And he had a view on after Liberation Day, that we should go into quiet mode and let our partners think about the kind of the shock and awe that he presented,” Bessent said when asked about his message to the president. A CNN team is just outside of El Salvador’s capital following a visit to the country’s notorious mega-prison, the Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT). That will mean all goods from the country are subject to a tariff of at least 104%. McFadden, however, did not immediately restore AP’s access. He delayed his order for one week for the White House to appeal. This post was updated with more of Trump’s remarks at the NRCC dinner. “They are dying to make a deal,” Trump said, essentially saying that foreign leaders are groveling to avoid the tariffs: “Please, please sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything sir.” CNN’s Jen Christensen contributed to this report. The legal action is being filed in partnership with the New York Civil Liberties Union and The Legal Aid Society which is representing two clients they say are at risk of deportation under Trump’s policy. “We’re gonna have to use those great law firms, I think, to help us with that, but we’re gonna probably do that, actually. We’re gonna use them and we’re getting them for the right price. Because we have to — we need a lot of talent,” Trump said. “We had a great meeting today, I think we are there. But just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there, you just gotta get there. Close your eyes and get there, it’s a phenomenal bill … just stop grandstanding,” the president said. Elon Musk, the billionaire who has become Trump’s most powerful adviser, has criticized the tariffs and lashed out against trade adviser Peter Navarro, after Navarro dismissed the Tesla founder as a “car assembler.” Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne added in separate post on X that “Canada will continue to respond with purpose and force to President Trump’s unjustified tariffs.” “Coal is critical to achieving American Energy and AI Dominance,” she said. Pressed on the impact on farmers, Tillis called it a “stability issue” for businesses, adding, “We’ve got a lot of uncertainty.” Chaos and fear unleashed by his “Liberation Day” trade war has only made him more adamant about his lifelong conviction that the world’s greatest economy is a victim of cheating rivals bent on ripping it off. However, there’s no guarantee stocks will remain buoyant. “The American people are speaking already, and they don’t like what they’re seeing. They’re anxious. They’re worried, and they’re worried about the chaos of what Trump is doing, in addition to worrying about how deep these tariffs — how high these tariffs go, in terms of cost. He never outlined a policy like this,” Schumer said.
