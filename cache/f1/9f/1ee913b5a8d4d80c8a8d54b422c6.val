Beijing has 'sufficient reserve of policy tools': Chinese Premier Li Qiang over Trump's tariff war Trump Tariffs News Live: Higher US tariffs on nearly 60 economies take effect Trump Tariffs News Live: Trump's top trade rep under fire before Senate committee after days of market chaos Asian shares deepen losses after another Wall St retreat as tariffs due to take effect 'Keeping India's interests at forefront': Union minister Piyush Goyal on US tariffs China is attempting to impose additional unjustified tariffs. Trump triples tariffs on low-value Chinese shipments after Beijing's retaliation China’s second-highest leader Li Qiang said on Tuesday that the country has the necessary tools to handle economic challenges, following widespread tariffs imposed by the United States, China’s main trading partner. "China's macroeconomic policy this year takes full account of various uncertainties and has a sufficient reserve of policy tools," Premier Li Qiang told European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen during a phone call, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. "China can fully hedge against adverse external effects, and is fully confident of maintaining sustained and healthy economic development." White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says, "...The president's message has been simple and consistent from the beginning to countries around the world... America does not need other countries as much as other countries need us, and President Trump knows this...On the other hand, countries like China, which have chosen to retaliate and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers, are making a mistake. President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break, and America will not break under his leadership. He is guided by a firm belief that America must be able to produce essential goods for our people and export them to the rest of the world. A strong America cannot be solely dependent on foreign countries for our food, medicines, and critical minerals, and America must always maintain a robust defence supply chain. Reprioritizing and strengthening our manufacturing industry are essential national and economic security issues of the utmost importance to President Trump. By focusing on supercharging the onshoring of American manufacturing, the president is already delivering on his promise to usher in an economic golden age for our country..." Trump Tariffs News Live: US stocks back in negative territory as rally fizzles Japan's benchmark Nikkei index fell in early trading on Wednesday, following losses on Wall Street driven by concerns over US tariffs and the ongoing trade war with China. The Nikkei 225 was down 2.67%, at 32,130.00, after a strong 6% rebound on Tuesday, which came in the wake of US President Donald Trump's announcement of broad tariffs. President Donald Trump has claimed that tariffs imposed on trading partners are generating $2 billion a day for the United States.Speaking at the White House’s East Room during an event on coal, Trump addressed a group of lawmakers, cabinet members, industry leaders and coal miners. He insisted that the tariffs are already paying off, calling them “somewhat explosive” and insisting they are essential to his economic strategy.“We’ve had talks with many, many countries who want to make deals,” he said. “Our problem is, we can’t see that many that fast. But we don’t have to because the tariffs are on, and money is pouring in at a level we’ve never seen.”He added that business leaders are now looking to relocate their operations to the US to avoid tariff penalties. White House confirms 84% tariff on Chinese goods starting today We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States. We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do. US President Donald Trump's latest round of sweeping tariffs—now fully in effect—are expected to deliver a significant blow to China's economy, with Goldman Sachs warning that the 104 per cent total tariff on Chinese goods could slash Beijing's growth by 2.4 percentage points. China, which has set a 5 per cent growth target for the year, may fall short if the trade tensions intensify. Goldman Sachs is forecasting a lower 4.5 per cent growth, cautioning that risks to this outlook remain tilted to the downside. The stiff tariffs took full effect just after midnight on Wednesday, following Trump's April 2 announcement that nearly all US trading partners would face a minimum 10 per cent import tax—with far steeper rates for countries running trade surpluses with the United States. 'Now it's our turn to do the ripping': Donald Trump 'Many countries ripped us off, now it's our turn': Trump hours before tariffs hit US, China clash as Trump set to unleash more tariffs Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni announced on Tuesday that she would travel to Washington next week to meet with US President Donald Trump to discuss tariffs, as the European Union works to prevent a full-scale trade war. In remarks to Italian businesses, confirmed by her office, Meloni revealed plans to reallocate up to 25 billion euros (€27 billion) from existing EU funds to help mitigate the impact of Trump’s new duties.Meloni supported the EU's efforts to find a negotiated resolution but stressed the importance of collective engagement. "This is a negotiation that must see us all involved at every level," she stated, confirming her visit to Washington on April 17, where she intends to address the issue directly with President Trump.A member of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, Meloni was the only EU leader invited to Trump's inauguration in January and has worked to maintain ties with the Republican administration despite its policies. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani added that Italy's good relations with the Trump administration could help facilitate a positive resolution.Meloni has criticised the tariffs as "wrong" and warned against panic, asserting that a trade war between Europe and the US would benefit no one. She also indicated that Italy would help affected businesses, noting potential reallocation of funds to support employment and productivity. “Companies are pouring back into our country,” Trump said at the National Republican congressional committee dinner. “I know what the hell I’m doing. I know what I’m doing, and you know what I’m doing, too. That’s why you vote for me.” He added that after years of countries ripping off the United States, “now it’s our turn to do the ripping”. US stocks plunged on Tuesday after a volatile day, as Wall Street swung from a significant early gain to steep losses due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s trade war. The S&P 500 soared 4.1% at the start, but quickly reversed course, dropping as much as 3% before trimming the loss to 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 320 points, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.1%. Global stock markets had initially rallied, with Japan, Paris, and Shanghai seeing strong gains. However, analysts warned that more volatility is likely in the coming days and hours. Investors remain uncertain about how long Trump will maintain his aggressive tariffs, which could raise prices for U.S. consumers and slow the economy. Some fear that prolonged tariffs could lead to a recession, but there is hope that negotiations could help avoid the worst-case scenario. Trump expressed optimism on Tuesday, announcing progress with South Korea and other countries eager to strike deals with the U.S. However, China warned it would retaliate against further tariff hikes. The U.S. is set to impose a 104% tariff on Chinese goods after midnight, with no exemptions. Stocks of companies with extensive global supply chains, like Ralph Lauren and Best Buy, suffered losses. Meanwhile, health insurers gained after stronger-than-expected Medicare payments were announced. The bond market saw rising Treasury yields, reflecting expectations for economic strength. Stocks fluctuated dramatically on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 erasing nearly all of an early 4% gain to rise just 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 254 points, while the Nasdaq Composite hovered near breakeven. Earlier in the day, global markets rallied on hopes that President Trump might ease up on his trade war after talks with other countries. However, the S&P 500 remained nearly 17% below its February peak, despite a 1.2% gain by afternoon. Global markets saw significant gains, with Tokyo rising 6%, Paris up 2.5%, and Shanghai climbing 1.6%.The major concern remains the impact of Trump’s upcoming tariffs, scheduled to take effect after midnight. While some analysts expect the market to continue experiencing volatility, the real question is how long these tariffs will stay in place, as prolonged tariffs could slow the economy and potentially lead to a recession. The shrill voices that you're hearing this week about tariffs are the same scoundrels and frauds who never thought twice about when the US lost 90,000 factories and plants.

The change marks a significant shift from past policy, as packages under $800 had been exempt from tariffs until this year.The so-called "de minimis" rule, which Trump scrapped last week, had primarily benefited Chinese e-commerce platforms like Temu and Shein. US President Donald Trump on Tuesday stated that his administration was securing "tailored deals" with trading partners after the US imposed stringent tariffs in response to trade imbalances with various countries. Speaking at an event on US energy policy, Trump remarked, "We're doing very well and making, I call them tailored deals, not off the rack, these are highly tailored deals." He added that Japan and South Korea were both sending delegations to the US to negotiate agreements, with other countries also seeking to make deals. Taiwan exporters count the cost of Trump's 'ridiculous' tariffs 'Mistake for China to retaliate': White House imposes 104% tariffs on China We're going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. When they hear that, they will leave China … and they're going to be opening up their plants all over the place in our country. Tariff critics are 'scoundrels and frauds,' Donald Trump says US President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at boosting coal mining in the US, seeking to "more than double" electricity production to meet growing demands from artificial intelligence technology. The orders will remove regulatory barriers to coal extraction and halt the closure of many coal-fired power plants. Trump pledged to end government bias against coal and directed the Department of Justice to challenge any state or local regulations hurting coal miners. Environmental groups, like Evergreen, criticized the move as a bailout for fossil fuel donors. Despite a decline in coal production in recent years, Trump’s administration continues to prioritize fossil fuels, recently rolling back environmental regulations set by his predecessor, Joe Biden. TOI explainer: The math behind Donald Trump’s 104% tariffs on China Ryan Bivens, a grain farmer in Kentucky who supplies corn to major bourbon producers, already operated at a loss last year due to rising inflation. Now, President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war threatens to worsen the blow.Industries across the US are bracing for costlier imports and tighter export markets as countries prepare to retaliate against Trump's tariffs. America's whiskey sector—often a target in trade disputes—is once again in the crosshairs, with distillers and their supply chains, from farmers to barrel-makers, bracing for economic fallout.While Trump’s tariff strategy is aimed at shielding domestic steel and aluminium, it’s squeezing other industries—particularly in Republican strongholds. The very workers and regions that helped return him to the White House are now facing some of the steepest consequences. Trump Tariffs News Live: Stocks give up an early gain as uncertainty about Trump's tariffs reigns Manufacturers struggling to make long-term plans. Farmers facing retaliation from Chinese buyers. US households burdened with higher prices. Republican senators are confronting the Trump administration with those worries and many more as they fret about the economic impact of the president's sweeping tariff strategy that went into effect Wednesday.In a Senate hearing and interviews with reporters this week, Republican skepticism of President Donald Trump's policies ran unusually high. While GOP lawmakers made sure to direct their concern at Trump's aides and advisers - particularly US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who appeared before the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday - it still amounted to a rare Republican break from a president they have otherwise championed.Lawmakers had reason to worry: the stock market has been in a volatile tumble for days and economists are warning that the plans could lead to a recession."Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told Greer as he pressed for an answer on which Trump aide to hold accountable if there is an economic downturn. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran said on Tuesday that some of the tariffs imposed by the US are likely to remain. He explained that the core issue isn’t the tariffs themselves, but the disruption of a long-established global model. Globalisation allowed goods to be produced where it’s cost-effective and sold where there’s demand, he noted. Chandrasekaran highlighted that supply chains are complex, and changes can't happen overnight due to challenges like talent and raw material sourcing. He believes tariffs won’t return to zero, with some elements staying in place. He also mentioned that the Tata Group is building seven new factories, including in electric vehicles, batteries, and semiconductors, which will create 500,000 jobs by 2027. 'America does not need other countries as much as other countries need us': White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on trade tariffs Japan's Nikkei dives, yen rallies as US tariffs bite US stocks dive after another stunning reversal as uncertainty reigns about Trump's tariffs ‘Highly tailored deals’: Trump says leaders ‘flying in’ to negotiate trade pacts A recent Pew Research Center survey revealed that Americans largely view increased tariffs on China negatively. Conducted before Trump’s April 2 announcement of a 34% reciprocal tariff but after the imposition of 20% tariffs over China’s failure to curb fentanyl precursor flow, the survey found about half of US adults believe the tariffs will harm both the country and themselves personally. Democrats strongly felt the tariffs would be detrimental, while more Republicans saw them as beneficial for the US. However, Republicans were more likely to think the tariffs would negatively affect them personally, with many uncertain or seeing limited impact. President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs go into full effect, including a combined 104% on China 'President who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street': Donald Trump The White House announced on Tuesday that a 104 per cent tariff on China would come into effect starting Wednesday, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing tariff tensions that have unsettled global markets. During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described China’s retaliation against the US as a “mistake,” asserting that America’s response would be forceful and unwavering.Leavitt stated, "When America is punched, it punches back harder," emphasising that the new tariffs were part of the Trump administration's efforts to address what it considers unfair trade practices that harm American workers. She criticised China's trade policies, accusing them of exacerbating economic difficulties for US workers."President Trump made it clear that the era of American economic surrender is over," Leavitt declared. "He will not allow American workers and companies to be exploited by foolish trade practices." She added that while President Trump would not consider delaying or extending the tariffs, he remained open to negotiations if China was willing to engage.Leavitt explained that the tariffs targeted not only monetary duties imposed by other nations on US goods but also non-monetary barriers to American trade. Meanwhile, China condemned the US tariffs as "groundless" and labelled them a form of unilateral bullying, according to a Ministry of Commerce spokesperson. The United States and China moved closer to an all-out trade war on Tuesday, as President Donald Trump prepared to impose a new wave of tariffs on dozens of trade partners.Global markets reeled after sweeping 10% US tariffs took effect over the weekend, triggering a sharp sell-off and stoking fears of a global recession.Tariff rates on imports from multiple economies are set to climb further at 12:01am ET Wednesday, with levies on Chinese goods since Trump’s return to office now reaching a staggering 104%.The latest escalation follows Beijing’s resistance to Trump’s trade strategy. Despite continued market losses—major US indexes tumbled again on Tuesday—the president remains defiant, insisting the policy will help restore America’s manufacturing base by pushing companies to relocate operations back to the US. Wall Street stocks fell again on Tuesday, and US oil prices dropped to a multi-year low as fears over President Donald Trump’s escalating trade wars overshadowed hopes for a market rebound. Global equities had regained some ground after significant losses last week, with Europe and Asia posting gains. US markets initially surged on optimism about potential negotiations with Japan and South Korea, suggesting Trump's trade conflict might be short-lived.However, investor confidence waned as the White House confirmed massive tariffs on China would take effect overnight, leaving the market uncertain. Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital noted that investors are seeking clarity, which remains elusive, and now see a greater than 50% chance of a US recession. The S&P 500 closed 1.6% down, below 5,000 points for the first time in nearly a year. Oil prices fell below $60 a barrel due to a bleak economic outlook, and the global trade war intensified. Tokyo stocks extended losses Wednesday and the yen jumped against the dollar after US tariffs against a slew of countries including Japan came into force.Around half an hour after the levies took effect, the Nikkei 225 index was down 4.86 percent at 31,407.66. The yen strengthened 1.1 percent to 144.73 per dollar.

He stated the move would pressure pharmaceutical companies to "leave China" and establish manufacturing in the US to sell to the domestic market. Trump emphasized that many countries had previously exploited the US, and now it’s America’s turn to take action. No specific details were provided. Trump Tariffs News Live: Italy's Meloni says to visit US for tariff talks April 17 Trump defends ‘explosive’ tariffs, claims $2 billion flowing in every day Rupee plunges 31 paise to 86.57 against US dollar in early trade. Trump Tariffs News Live: 'Some part of US tariffs here to stay,' says Tata Sons chairman Chandrasekaran In a speech largely focused on the Republicans’ 2024 win and jabs at Democrats, President Donald Trump repeatedly returned to his defence of tariffs, brushing aside concerns over market declines, inflation, and business impacts.“The shrill voices you’re hearing this week are the same frauds who ignored the loss of 90,000 US factories,” he said, blaming past policies for the decline in American manufacturing.“The globalists have been wrong about everything,” Trump added. “I’m proud to be the president for workers, not outsourcers—someone who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street.” President Donald Trump’s top trade negotiator faced intense criticism on Tuesday from senators alarmed by the president’s sweeping global tariffs, which have sparked a market downturn and increased fears of a recession due to a disrupted global trading system. Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina expressed frustration, accusing the administration of starting a trade war on multiple fronts. He questioned who would be held accountable if the tariffs led to higher prices and slower economic growth, adding, “I wish you well, but I am skeptical.”The criticism came after US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer testified before the Senate Finance Committee. He defended the tariffs, claiming they had prompted around 50 countries to negotiate trade deals, including Vietnam, which had lowered tariffs on US produce. Greer acknowledged, however, that the process would take time and be challenging.Many lawmakers, including Republicans, are growing uneasy as stocks plummeted following the announcement of the tariffs. Some are hoping negotiations will lead to a suspension or reduction of the measures. Senators pressed Greer for clarification on the administration’s goals, with some, like Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, questioning the lack of a clear strategy and fearing the tariffs might signal a return to 19th-century protectionism.Amid the turmoil, there are increasing calls for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority over trade. Senators Chuck Grassley and Maria Cantwell recently introduced legislation to require presidential justification for new tariffs, with a 60-day period for congressional approval. However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune dismissed the proposal, saying it had no future. The White House confirmed to AFP that additional US tariffs on Chinese imports will reach 104 percent starting Wednesday, as Washington intensifies its stance following Beijing’s vow to "fight to the end" against the levies. President Donald Trump had previously threatened a further 50 percent tariff on Chinese goods if Beijing did not withdraw its planned retaliation. The White House confirmed that Trump will move forward with this plan, bringing the total increase in tariffs for the year to 104 percent. A fresh wave of US tariffs took effect against dozens of trading partners Wednesday, with President Donald Trump taking specific aim at China and accelerating his trade war. The customized rates for nearly 60 economies supersede baseline duties that took effect Saturday. New levels largely range from 11 percent to 50 percent, but retaliation from Beijing will see the US tariffs imposed on China this year rise to a staggering 104 percent. Trump signs order to 'turbocharge' coal mining in United States Taiwanese exporters are crunching numbers and talking to American clients as they scramble to figure out how to respond to US President Donald Trump's tariff blitz that threatens to derail their businesses.While the final impact is not yet known, factory owners on the island are clear eyed on one thing: moving operations to the United States is easier said than done. "Taiwan's structure is what makes this industry viable," the owner of a machine tool exporter told AFP on the condition of anonymity, highlighting the island's network of small and medium-sized factories supplying his company."There are so many components, like gears, belts and others -- the US doesn't have these industries. Setting up a factory in the US would not be worth it," he said, describing Trump's policy as "ridiculous". The White House has confirmed a significant tariff hike on China, following the country's retaliatory measures against the US. As outlined in the official document, starting from 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 9, 2025, tariffs on certain Chinese goods will increase from 34% to 84%. The changes will be reflected in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), with adjustments made to heading 9903.01.63 and U.S. note 2 to subchapter III of chapter 99. This move comes in response to China's announcement of countermeasures following the implementation of Executive Order 14257, further escalating the trade tensions between the two nations.

On Tuesday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.6%, erasing an earlier 4.1% gain, and closing nearly 19% below its February peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, and the Nasdaq lost 2.1%, amid mounting investor unease over the direction of President Donald Trump’s trade war.The new tariffs were scheduled to take effect just after midnight US Eastern time, leaving global investors on edge.Earlier in the day, markets had seen a temporary rally, with gains of 6% in Tokyo, 2.5% in Paris, and 1.6% in Shanghai, before sentiment reversed. US President Donald Trump defended his trade policies, claiming the US is now “pouring in” billions from tariffs on foreign imports. Speaking on Tuesday while signing executive orders supporting the coal industry, Trump highlighted the explosive impact of these tariffs, which are set to affect over 60 countries. He stated that tariffs are generating up to $2 billion a day but did not provide specific figures or details on which tariffs were responsible. Trump mentioned that many countries have requested exemptions but emphasized that the tariffs are still in place.During the same event, Trump signed four executive orders aimed at revitalising the coal industry. He promised to "turbocharge coal mining" and increase electricity production to meet growing energy demands, especially from artificial intelligence and data centres. The orders include a moratorium on Obama-era coal regulations and measures allowing older coal plants to stay operational. As President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to stir turmoil in global markets, some prominent figures who once supported his campaign are now expressing doubts. Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, and even Elon Musk have joined a growing number of Republicans in voicing concern over the tariffs, which are set to take effect on Wednesday.Portnoy, on his "Davey Day Trader" livestream, admitted to significant financial losses, estimating his losses at up to $20 million due to the market slump. Despite this, he remains loyal to Trump, noting, "I think they’re smarter than me when it comes to these tariffs," and saying he’ll give it a few weeks to see how the situation unfolds.Joe Rogan, the influential podcaster, has distanced himself from Trump’s trade war, calling the feud with Canada “stupid” and criticizing the impact of tariffs on relations between the two countries. Rogan has also opposed Trump on other issues, such as immigration.Bill Ackman warned of a potential "economic nuclear winter" due to the tariffs, citing risks to the country’s economic progress. Elon Musk, meanwhile, criticized the tariffs for increasing costs at Tesla, advocating for a zero-tariff zone between Europe and North America, despite pushback from Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro. Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal stated that the Government is working on a bilateral trade agreement as was decided between Prime Minister Modi and US President Trump in February. His remarks came in the face of the tariffs imposed by Trump's administration.Piyush Goyal assured the businesspersons that the government is "keeping India's interests at the forefront" and expressed hope that the bilateral trade agreement will "power" the economy towards Viksit Bharat 2047.On US tariff impacts, Union minister Piyush Goyal told ANI, "We are working on a bilateral trade agreement as was decided between Prime Minister Modi and US President Trump in February... We had a series of engagements, all of which are going in the right direction. We are covering a wide area of subjects and products. I can assure businesspersons across the country that we are keeping India's best interests at the forefront... Our bilateral trade agreement will power the economy towards Viksit Bharat 2047..."Meanwhile, Union minister Hardeep Puri on Tuesday said he was confident India will emerge stronger from the fallout of the US administration tariffs once the bilateral trade agreement between the two partner countries is finalised. Trump Tariffs News Live: Canada says tariffs on US auto imports come into force Wednesday Facing the ripple effects of President Trump’s 26% reciprocal tariffs, India is looking to a bilateral trade agreement with the US as its primary defence. As the global trade landscape shifts rapidly, New Delhi sees a direct deal as the most strategic path forward to avoid being caught in the tariff crossfire.“Agreed on the importance of the early conclusion of the Bilateral Trade Agreement,” said EAM Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in a X post on Monday, following a conversation with US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Canada will impose a 25 percent tariff on certain US auto imports starting Wednesday, in retaliation against US President Donald Trump's levies on autos and parts. Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne stated that Canada is responding strongly to "unwarranted and unreasonable tariffs." The new tariffs will target vehicles not compliant with the North American free trade agreement, mainly cars and light trucks with less than 75 percent North American parts—about 67,000 vehicles annually. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the measures last week. China on Tuesday refuted US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's claim that Beijing interferes in the operations of the Panama Canal.As Hegseth visited the Central American country amid acute tension over the waterway, the Chinese Embassy released a statement urging the United States to halt what the embassy called "blackmail" and "plundering" of Panama. US President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries kicked in Wednesday, slapping Chinese goods with a steep 104% duty and intensifying his global trade war—even as his administration moves toward talks with several nations. The sweeping tariffs have disrupted a global trading system that held steady for decades, stoked recession fears, and sent stock markets around the world into a sharp decline. Trump's tariff moves have rattled global markets, sent the S&P 500 toward bear territory, and triggered panic among businesses and consumers already bracing for rising costs. Wall Street stocks remained firmly in the red during the final hours of trading on Tuesday, as a rebound rally lost momentum amid growing uncertainty over President Trump's tariff policies. By 1910 GMT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 0.7 percent to 37,701.77, a decline of more than 1,700 points from its earlier peak. This pattern was mirrored in the other two major US indices, which also saw significant losses.
