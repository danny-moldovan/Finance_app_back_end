Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue," Leavitt said after a reporter asked if the administration is concerned the arguing between Navarro and Musk could result in public confusion over the impacts of the tariffs. "Thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday and today, we had a big ruling, too," Trump said. "We had a very big ruling today, but we will continue to deport these monsters under the Alien Enemies Act." Greer replied, "Right now, this minute, we're working on negotiations with countries who believe they can achieve reciprocity with us and get their trade deficit down." The USDA is among several federal agencies that have encouraged workers to quit through a “deferred resignation” program that offered several months of paid leave. Broader staff cuts are expected at the USDA in the near future as part of the Trump administration’s broad effort to reduce the federal workforce. “Many of these districts were won by Harris and are some of the swingiest, most competitive seats in the chamber,” she said. “We’ve been working with these candidates for months at this point as they build really strong campaigns that are resonating with voters.” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the Trump administration's tariffs are both a negotiating tool to close America's trade deficits with other countries and a long-term punitive measure to raise revenue for the federal treasury. Trump also said that delegations from Japan, South Korea and other nations are flying to Washington to strike deals with the United States and that the federal government has taken in nearly $2 billion a day in tariff revenue. He has said he's open to hearing countries' proposals to negotiate the tariffs, even as he and his advisers vow to enforce them. Ken Dilanian Gordon Lubold "This is a big unforced error that requires a big response," Wyden said. Greer said that “we will see where that goes” while speaking about U.S.-China trade relations amid Trump’s threats to impose an additional 50% tariff on the country’s import, which could bring total tariffs on Chinese goods to 104%. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the sole Republican to vote against Elbridge Colby, Trump's nominee to be the undersecretary of defense for policy. Greer said the Trump administration does not have a timeline on negotiations with other countries that want to pursue reciprocal trade with the United States, as “the outcome is more important than setting something artificially for us.” "The Order avowedly—and severely—punishes WilmerHale for its attorneys’ advocacy on behalf of clients and causes the President does not like. And it does so for the avowed purpose of deterring other law firms from engaging in the same constitutionally protected conduct," it added. Jung said it’s good news for South Korea that Trump said countries other than China may be able to reduce or defer tariffs through negotiations. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced today that it is targeting 35 Republican-held House seats, noting that recent gains in special elections have suggested a midterm election environment that will not be kind to Republicans. The committee is also launching a program to raise money for its eventual nominees. The fresh 25% duties from Canada will affect U.S. autos not covered by the U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade agreement, as well as all U.S.-made auto parts in Canadian vehicles. Paul has been one of the lead Republican voices criticizing the widespread tariffs. The resolution was also joined by Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Tim Kaine, D-Va.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Peter Welch, D-Vt.; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, ordered the administration to “put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP’s use of disfavored terminology.” Trump insists he’s not considering hitting the pause button on the next round of escalatory tariffs after markets yesterday suffered their worst day since the start of the Covid pandemic. The president said he’s unfazed by the short-term financial pain. “I don’t mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end,” he said. NBC’s Peter Alexander reports for "TODAY." Rebecca Shabad Wyden called the move “classic Donald Trump," saying the president is “really good at talking about problems,” but “pretty damn bad at fixing them.” Lawrence Hurley More than 1,000 staff members have resigned from two Agriculture Department divisions through a Trump administration program intended to shrink the federal government, according to an internal USDA email obtained by NBC News. He added, "China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they don’t know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen! GOD BLESS THE USA." The final vote was 54-45, with Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan joining Republicans to vote in support of Colby. Trump spoke tonight amid ongoing stock market fallout in response to his tariff plans. "And Republicans are running scared— for good reason,” DelBene said this morning on "Way too Early." Trump’s unprecedented tariffs on global imports into the United States take effect Wednesday, reshuffling a global economic order that has largely stood for generations. Yesterday, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to recently enacted gun restrictions in New York. Sen. Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem objecting to what he called the "diversion of agency resources and institutional focus away from domestic terrorism prevention efforts.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing today that Trump and Meloni would meet for an “official working visit.” The full committee hearing on Trump's trade policy agenda kicks off at 10 a.m. The court today halted a lower court ruling requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had terminated as it seeks to reshape the federal government and slash spending. Parés also pointed to a key victory for Democrats earlier this month in Wisconsin, where the liberal, Democratic-backed candidate in the state’s Supreme Court race beat a conservative, Republican-backed candidate who was boosted by millions of dollars from tech mogul Elon Musk. "Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good," Trump wrote. "We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States. Like with South Korea, we are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. 'ONE STOP SHOPPING' is a beautiful and efficient process!!!" Americans "are seeing prices go up, programs that they depend on being attacked, like Social Security and Medicaid, folks who serve our communities losing their jobs,” DelBene said. Asked by a reporter what it would take for Trump to negotiate a trade agreement with China's Xi Jinping as tariff tensions between the two countries escalate, Leavitt said: "The Chinese want to make a deal, they just don't know how to do it. That’s why there will be 104% tariffs going into effect on China tonight at midnight.” He said the goals of the tariffs are to address the $1.2 trillion trade deficit, which he pinned on the Biden administration, pointing to “the offshoring ... and the nonreciprocal treatment that led to that.” "Until they make a deal with us, that’s what it’s going to be," Trump said at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner. "I think they’ll make a deal at some point, China will. They want to make a deal. They really do." Musk and Navarro have been trading insults since Trump announced sprawling global tariffs last week. Sahil Kapur "We want to negotiate with you," he said. Greer's explanation came during a Senate Finance Committee hearing this, during which Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., pressed him on what the Trump administration is ultimately seeking to accomplish with its sprawling tariffs. Trump has vowed to defend and expand gun rights. In 2023, he said at an NRA convention that mass shootings are not "a gun problem." The department requested that all departing staffers wait until April 30 to leave “because of this significant and sudden loss of knowledge and experience,” it said in the email, which was provided by a USDA staffer who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to share the message. The staffers work in divisions that aim to market U.S. crops and other agricultural products and protect animal and plant health. Denise Chow The Chinese territory is subject to the same combined tariff of 54% that Trump has imposed on goods from mainland China, with the latest 34% set to take effect tomorrow. Trump has also threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff if China does not withdraw the 34% retaliatory tariff it has also announced on U.S. imports. Ryan J. Reilly “The trade deficit has been decades in the making, and it’s not going to be solved overnight,” he added. Yixuan Tan Greer said that the U.S. is "the consumer of last resort" for many countries, especially in Asia, adding, "These countries have to sell here." The Chinese Commerce Ministry said China is ready to “fight to the end” if the U.S. imposes further tariffs as it plans to enact its own retaliatory tariffs. NBC News’ Janis Mackey Frayer explains the items made in China that could see the highest price hikes including retail, footwear and toys. Later, Trump will deliver remarks at a dinner hosted by the National Republican Congressional Committee, a Hill committee that works to elect GOP lawmakers in the House. Kloe Zheng The Kospi index in South Korea was down 1.36%, down 20% since July and confirming a bear market, CNBC reported. Sydney CarruthSydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News. Agency employees last night received an emailed memo from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, titled “Reshaping of the DHS Workforce” and viewed by NBC News. It offers DHS employees several ways to choose to leave their jobs, including taking a buyout of up to $25,000 or early retirement. The due date for the program is the end of day on Monday, April 14. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said her party is "on offense" on the "Trump-Musk agenda" in targeting dozens of GOP congressional districts in next year's mid-term elections. “We’re trying to remedy a situation persisted for many years, and it would be wonderful if the Chinese agreed with that and wanted to persist in work with us on that, but that’s not where they are, and the president has recognized this, and he wants to focus on other partners,” Greer said. "They’re all coming here. Japan is coming here as we speak," he said. "For too long, the Second Amendment, which establishes the fundamental individual right of Americans to keep and bear arms, has been treated as a second-class right. No more. It is the policy of this Department of Justice to use its full might to protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens," the memo says. The average tariff faced by the dozens of nations Trump targeted is 29%, with many as high as 40%. The White House posted the full list here. Chinese imports will carry a cumulative rate of 104% because of new tariffs Trump imposed this year, on top of levies he had already enacted during his first term. Those took effect late Tuesday. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in his opening remarks at the Senate Finance Committee hearing that the U.S. economy is in "purgatory" because of Trump's tariff policies. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and New York police officer who became a wealthy pro-Trump podcaster, harshly criticized the bureau for years before President Donald Trump chose him to be deputy director. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., urged Greer to focus on specific products rather than "using this broad instrument," arguing that "there's going to be an awful lot of collateral damage." "Congress has the power to reverse these tariffs, and we should do so immediately," Warren said. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., slammed Trump's tariff policies in a CNBC interview, saying he "can't support a fallacy that is going to make us lose our wealth." Up until this year, shipments valued under $800, known as de minimis packages, were exempt from tariffs. Kyle Stewart Lee, who is under U.S. sanctions over his role in a government crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, said the international financial hub would not impose any retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and would remain a free port. “There’s going to be a whole lot of collateral damage in the process if you all continue with these trade policies and services and in other areas,” Wyden said. In the lead up to the question, Tillis said that people in management consulting "like to focus on" the idea of having "one throat to choke." Stella Kim The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment tonight. “History is on our side here," she said. "We only need three seats to take back the majority, and they have a microscopic majority right now.” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., asked Greer about the administration's blanket tariffs, saying he didn't have the expertise to judge the idea, but still had some skepticism. House Republicans voted today to block a bipartisan push to allow lawmakers who are new parents to vote remotely rather than in person, officially ending a GOP standoff over an issue that had ground legislative business to a halt for the past week. Vance, author of the 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” made the remarks while defending Trump’s new 34% tariff on Chinese goods in a Fox News interview last week, saying: “We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture.” "We’re going to tariff our pharmaceuticals, and once we do that, they’re going to come rushing back into our country, because we’re the big market," Trump said at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner in Washington. The AP sued in February after it was excluded from White House events and Trump’s travels over its refusal to change references to the Gulf of Mexico to Trump’s preferred “Gulf of America” in its coverage. Yesterday, Johnson also took to social media to urge Trump to take European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's proposed trade deal. "I have a retirement account, too," Paul continued. "I want my retirement account to stay there, and I think tariffs is going to decimate it." Kate Santaliz EMILY’s List, an organization that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, endorsed eight candidates today in competitive Virginia legislative districts as Democrats seek to expand their majority in November. That would essentially allow a member who is absent to “pair” their vote with someone who plans to vote on the other side of the issue. That person would vote “present,” and the congressional record would reflect the position of each member. tv McConnell concluded by saying, "Make no mistake: America will not be made great again by those who are content to manage our decline." Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., asked Greer about the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which were completed in the first Trump administration, saying that with his new tariffs, Trump "is ripping up these agreements with our allies that we negotiated with." Trump predicted that Republicans would win the midterm elections in 2026 by a “thundering landslide” at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner in Washington. Rob Wile “It is surprising and sad to hear the vice president say such ignorant and impolite words,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said today at a regular briefing in Beijing. Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP filed a motion today seeking to permanently block Trump's executive order targeting the firm, which previously employed Robert Mueller, who led the Russia investigation after the 2016 election. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said global markets opening higher this morning following a mass sell-off in reaction to Trump’s sprawling tariffs was just a “good day in hospice” and not a lasting sign of market recovery. But just three Republican incumbents — Nebraska’s Don Bacon, New York’s Mike Lawler and Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick — represent districts former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in last year’s presidential election. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in his opening statement at a hearing on Trump's trade agenda this morning that the U.S. needs to "think strategically about tariff policy, including how to minimize unnecessary costs on American families." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports Trump threatened yesterday will go into effect at midnight tonight, raising U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to a combined 104%. "President Trump caused this trade crisis — and Canada is responding with purpose and with force," Carney wrote on X. Reuters reported earlier today that the two leaders are expected to talk tariffs during their meeting. European Union foreign ministers met yesterday in Luxembourg to hash out how they plan to respond to the tariffs. DelBene noted that the party in the White House tends to fare poorly in midterm election years. Mithil Aggarwal Greer leads the office that negotiates trade agreements with other countries and resolves trade disputes. His testimony comes as the administration has sought to calm the jitters of supporters over the tariffs' economic impact. Peter Guo Tariffs on China are expected to rise to 104% at midnight tonight. Trump said tonight that his administration will "very shortly" announce tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Most of the districts are based in suburban areas, with five of them covering the suburbs around Richmond. All eight seats are held by Republicans, but Parés pointed to several reasons why she's feeling confident, including that several of the districts were won by then-Vice President Kamala Harris in November. The resolution is privileged, meaning it will be fast-tracked to the Senate floor for a vote. It requires a majority to pass. “The U.S. no longer adheres to free trade, arbitrarily undermining the internationally established rules of world trade, and its ruthless behavior damages global and multilateral trade,” John Lee, Hong Kong’s top leader, told reporters today. Crapo, who spent much of his opening statement criticizing former President Joe Biden and his administration's policy on trade, said "free trade, by definition, must be reciprocal." "We do not have it if others can impose barriers on us unchallenged," he said. "Our failure to enforce our rights over the last four years lost a lot of ground for us. This cannot continue, because what I am certain about is that American goods and services are innovative, high quality and globally competitive." Reporting from Hong Kong More From NBC Sarah Dean Markets in Asia were down Wednesday as Trump’s global tariffs took effect. The mere announcement of the duties last week sent shock waves through global markets and caused trillions of dollars in paper losses. Now, consumers and investors alike will begin to gauge the actual impact on the U.S. economy as the cost of the import taxes starts to flow through supply chains and into businesses and household budgets. McFadden shot down the administration’s argument that the AP’s request for media access to such events is a “demand for extra special access.” "While tariffs inherently may be seen at odds with free trade, we must also acknowledge that many of our trading partners deploy barriers that have gone unchallenged for too long," Crapo said, defending Trump's new tariffs. "Mr. Colby’s confirmation leaves open the door for the less-polished standard-bearers of restraint and retrenchment at the Pentagon to do irreparable damage to the system of alliances and partnerships which serve as force multipliers to U.S. leadership," McConnell said. He said the math behind the 25% U.S. tariff on South Korean goods was “problematic,” as Seoul’s effective rate toward the U.S. is in the 10% range, far below the 50% rate Trump claimed at his White House event announcing tariffs last week. "I really think we’re helped a lot by the tariff situation that’s going on, which is a good situation," he said. "It's great. It's going to be legendary." Alexandra Marquez Former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he is not running for his state's open Senate seat, saying that spending several years in Washington, D.C., was "just not right for me or my my family." House Democrats are setting their sights on some districts Trump won handily in November as they lay out their top targets as they look to take back the House next year. “We also have a lot of seats that were really, really close last time," she said. "We have seats that have been swinging — they went for Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024, there are nine of those seats. So those are all opportunities for us,” she said. The country will “actively” negotiate with U.S. officials, including Trump’s trade chief Jamieson Greer, to minimize the impact of Trump’s 25% duty on South Korean goods, head of trade negotiations Jung In-kyo said before flying to the U.S. China said earlier today that it will “fight to the end” if Trump goes forward with his plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods that are set to take effect at midnight, bringing the tariff amount to 104%. When asked yesterday whether tariffs were permanent or up for negotiation, Trump said, "they can both be true." Trump also said countries are sending trade delegations to Washington to negotiate the tariffs. Democrats need a net gain of three seats next year to take control of the House (they hold 213 seats, with two vacancies in solidly Democratic districts). The president’s party also typically loses seats in midterm elections, shedding an average of 20 House seats in presidents’ second terms, according to data from the University of California-Santa Barbara’s American Presidency Project. “As you saw in the Wisconsin state Supreme Court race just recently and then victories, you know, across the country last cycle, abortion continues to be a winning issue that motivates voters,” Parés said. ”Especially as the Trump administration, you know, kind of, continues to follow through with their, their threats and challenges to reproductive rights … voters are going to fight for that this November.” Paxton, a Republican hard-liner who has been a staunch Trump ally, described on Fox News why he's seeking to unseat Cornyn, an institutionalist and former deputy of Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has been in the Senate since 2002. Trump is also headlining the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual spring dinner tonight, a major fundraiser that a number of members are expected to attend. Bondi said in the memo that she would be the chair of the task force, which "is principally charged with developing and executing strategies to use litigation and policy to advance, protect, and promote compliance with the Second Amendment." Michael Kosnar “That’s an opportunity for us,” DelBene said, referring to James. She added, “Open seats can be easier” to flip. The Department of Homeland Security has renewed its push for employees to leave. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., blasted the administration for hitting allies, including Australia, with tariffs. "Look, I was honored that so many folks in New Hampshire, Washington, the president himself, offered a lot of support, so it made me rethink things for a little bit," Sununu, a Republican, told WMUR. "But at the end of the day it's just not right for me or my family. I think it's a very winnable seat for a Republican. It doesn't have to be me." "The advantage we have over everybody is that we’re the big market, so we’re going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals," Trump added. Lujan also asked Greer whether businesses are hurting in the wake of the new tariffs. "Some of them are excited about the prospects. Some are concerned because they're import-dependent," Greer answered. "We talked about their tremendous and unsustainable Surplus, Tariffs, Shipbuilding, large scale purchase of U.S. LNG, their joint venture in an Alaska Pipeline, and payment for the big time Military Protection we provide to South Korea," Trump said. “It’s kitchen table issues: economy, cost of housing, of food, of child care, of health care,” she said. China criticized Vice President JD Vance after he said the U.S. borrows and buys from “Chinese peasants.” The Trump administration is considering launching drone strikes on drug cartels in Mexico as part of an ambitious effort to combat criminal gangs trafficking narcotics across the southern border, according to six current and former U.S. military, law enforcement and intelligence officials with knowledge of the matter. Local "Mr. Greer, I gave you a chance to respond to the question, and what you said wasn't accurate," Wyden said. "Nobody disputes the president won the election up here on the dais, but nobody was told in the election campaign that we would have all of these people hurting now because of a flawed trade policy." Rebecca Kaplan The group previously endorsed former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., as she campaigns to flip the governor’s mansion back into the Democratic column. House GOP leaders are hoping to put the budget plan on the floor Wednesday, but aren’t close to having the votes yet. Johnson pitched the House Freedom Caucus on the blueprint last night, and leadership is hoping Trump’s direct involvement will help further melt the opposition. "There wasn’t any mention people from one end of the country to another feeling they’ve been wiped out financially," Wyden said. "Nobody heard about that." Senior Defense Department officials are considering a proposal to withdraw as many as 10,000 troops from Eastern Europe, sparking concern on both continents that it would embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to six U.S. and European officials who have been briefed on the matter. “So if the goal is to close trade deficits, then that would mean that the tariffs are a negotiating tool here. Is that right? Is that how you see it?,” Smith asked, noting the White House's explanation for the tariffs has changed several times, said. Economists and certain companies have said they expect rising prices because of the tariffs. “To protect working families in Virginia from the chaos working at the federal level, we don’t just have to take back the governor’s office. We need to make sure that progressive policies are created in our state legislatures,” Emily Parés, the group’s interim vice president of state and local campaigns, told NBC News. Johnson also pressed Greer on whether the administration wanted to move high-labor products to the U.S., pointing to the low unemployment rate and questioning whether the U.S. had enough available labor. With the two men talking over each other, Warner shouted at Greer to "answer the question on Australia." Zoë Richards “What I can say is I’m moving as quickly as possible, and a lot of these countries are moving very quickly, and we’re working on the weekends, we’re working at night, as folks want to engage on this,” Greer responded to a question from Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Chinese Premier Li Qiang today that China has a “critical” role to play in addressing possible trade diversion caused by Trump’s sweeping tariffs. "Why would any country want to do business with us, much less negotiate a trade deal, if we don't even honor our ongoing agreements?" Cortez Masto asked. A source familiar with the matter confirmed that members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus are among those who have been invited to the White House. Another source said Republicans in high-tax blue states, who want to lift the cap on the state and local tax deduction, were also invited. “He is in intensive care and stable,” his office said in a statement. “He is tired but glad to be back in South Jersey. His condition is improving, and he is on his way to making a full recovery.” The two divisions have nearly 13,000 employees, according to doge.gov. “Certainly, there’s a tariff revenue effect. If the countries do not do this, then they will be subject to the tariff. They’ll have tariff on foreign goods and stuff, American made goods,” Greer said. Durbin wrote that it was "imperative that both the Administration and Congress continue to address the underlying causes for domestic terrorism and adapt to the rapidly evolving trends and motivating factors inspiring extremists" and that the "diversion of domestic-terrorism focused resources without a clear plan from the Administration on how to combat this evolving threat makes Americans less safe." Isabella RamirezIsabella Ramirez is a politics intern with NBC News. It’s a preview of the message she hopes will be salient in the districts where Democrats plan to mount challenges. Dan De Luce “What I want to do is to get an understanding from you of what you see as the goals of this war that we’re in,” Smith said. “At various times, it’s been described as a goal to raise revenue to stop fentanyl trafficking, or to close trade deficits. So is the goal here to raise revenue for the federal treasury?” When Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., asked what were the Trump administration’s goals in engaging in a “trade war,” Greer denied the description: “Senator, this is not a trade war.” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said he is “concerned that there is no strategy at all,” while pressing Greer on the impact of China’s retaliatory tariffs on American consumers and small businesses during a hearing on the U.S. economy this morning. Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., pressed Greer several times about whether he agrees with Trump that American families will have to experience some pain as a result of the new tariffs. Later, she pressed Greer as to whether the administration would reverse course on tariffs if millions of jobs were lost. Melanie ZanonaMelanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News. In a phone call with Li, China’s No. 2 official, von der Leyen stressed that Europe and China have a responsibility to support a “free” and “fair” global trading system, her office said in a statement. "It's hard to project what's going to happen with prices," Greer said, going on to say inflation went down during Trump's first term when he implemented tariffs on China. "Of course, I agree with the president," said Greer, who added that the U.S. can't keep allowing Wall Street to run the economy. Suzy Khimm Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., joined in releasing the resolution, saying in a press release that "tariffs are taxes, and the power to tax belongs to Congress—not the president." Phil Helsel There are no new alerts at this time Read more on the Musk-Navarro feud here. news Alerts "Simply put, blacklisting and sanctioning law firms for representing the President’s political opponents, devoting resources to causes the President dislikes, or hiring attorneys who have investigated the President is anathema to our constitutional order," the filing says. Trump said that South Korea began making military payments during his first term. Trump will sign an executive order this afternoon on "unleashing American energy," according to a White House release on his schedule, which did not provide further details. Responding to news reports that staff members from the FBI's Domestic Terrorism Operations Section had been reassigned and that DHS had gutted funding for domestic terrorism-related prevention programs, Durbin wrote: “Taken together, these moves represent a broad institutional pullback from confronting the full scope of domestic terrorism threats at a time when experts continue to warn about intensifying danger, and the data points to the rising threat of attacks motivated by anti-government ideologies.” Frank Thorp Vproducer and off-air reporter Ali Vitali She called for a “negotiated resolution” to the challenges Trump’s new tariffs pose to the global economy, according to the statement. Trump has frequently targeted Mueller, a former FBI director who was the special counsel who oversaw the Russia probe into interference in the 2016 presidential election. The FBI has issued a call for agents to voluntarily serve as bodyguards for Deputy Director Dan Bongino, a break from past practice in which the bureau’s No. 2 officials did not have security details, two current and two former FBI officials familiar with the matter told NBC News. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will appear before the Senate Finance Committee this morning, where lawmakers are expected to grill him about about Trump's reciprocal tariffs. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., released a bipartisan resolution that would repeal Trump's tariffs. The resolution faces an uphill battle with Republicans controlling both chambers. Greer said the administration has told countries approaching the U.S. in order to negotiate that "if you have a better idea to achieve reciprocity and to get our trade deficit down, we want to talk to you." Shipments from China under $800 will now face a duty of 90% of their value or $75, a threefold increase from the 30% or $25 Trump set last Wednesday. “I just talked to one of the senior folks Wall Street, and he described today’s market as ‘a good day in hospice,’” Warner said during his line of questioning to Greer at the Senate Finance Committee hearing. “I loved your fancy Greek formula, which was basically bad math on steroids.” “I’m announcing that I’m running for U.S. Senate against John Cornyn, who apparently is running again for his fifth term, which would put him there three decades. It’s definitely time for a change in Texas,” Paxton told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. “Sometimes you have to mix it up a little bit,” he told reporters at a White House event. Katherine Doyle In that race, several left-leaning groups campaigned on the issue of abortion and reproductive rights to boost the eventual winner. Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford. Trump signed executive orders today to bolster the country’s declining coal industry, relaxing restrictions on coal mining, leasing and exports, in what the White House said was an effort to meet the energy-intensive needs of artificial intelligence data centers. "Many of them, especially in Asia, have built their entire economies around exporting to us," he said. "They’re very dependent on it, and that’s part of why we have this huge trade deficit with USMCA." South Korea’s top trade official will visit Washington today and tomorrow as the key U.S. ally seeks a reduction in tariffs. “And we saw what happened in Florida too, where Republicans won by huge margins," she said. "Those were slashed in half in just a few months. It kind of tells you the tenor of where the American people are at and their frustration and anger with Republicans, understandably.” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced tonight that he will challenge Sen. John Cornyn next year, setting the stage for what's expected to be an expensive GOP primary. “If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote. In his final question, Wyden asked Greer what the timeline would be for U.S. citizens who are hurting because of the tariffs to see some relief. Trump will meet this afternoon with a key group of House Republicans who are skeptical of the Senate-approved budget resolution to advance his agenda, according to a White House official. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked during a briefing about the public spat between Elon Musk and Trump's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, over tariffs. A WilmerHale spokesperson said the motion was a “step as part of our steadfast commitment to protecting our firm, our people, and — above all — our clients.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC He noted that trade should be a "win-win situation." A federal judge today called The Associated Press’ exclusion from White House events “contrary to the First Amendment” and ordered the Trump administration to treat the newswire as it would any other media publication.
