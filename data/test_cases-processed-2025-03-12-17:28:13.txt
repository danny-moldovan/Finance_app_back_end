Renaissance Technologies $22,521,664,000 Icahn Capital LP In the world of investing, the term \u201cmultibagger\u201d refers to stocks that have the potential to deliver returns several times greater than the original investment. One key factor that can help identify potential multibaggers is momentum. Momentum investing focuses on capitalizing on the continuation of existing market trends. Investors using this strategy look for stocks that are experiencing upward price movements, often driven by strong earnings reports, positive news, industry tailwinds, or overall market sentiment. The idea is simple: \u201cthe trend is your friend,\u201d and momentum can be a powerful force in identifying winners before they peak. The importance of momentum has been recognized by famous investors, but many of them emphasized the idea that it is crucial to catch momentum stocks early on.

Warren Buffett The US market is close to entering a correction mode as the absolute magnitude of decline since the mid-February peak is approaching 10%. The current policies of the new US administration, such as tariffs, federal jobs cuts and cuts in some large-scale public projects, are causing havoc among investors as many are fearing a scenario in which the US economy enters stagflation \u2013 a period of high inflation among weak economic growth and unemployment. Some analysts have pointed out that sectors reliant on government contracts, such as infrastructure and defense, are already experiencing heightened volatility as a result of these policy shifts. In a recent interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News, the President himself refused to rule out a recession in the current year and claimed that the economy is in \u201ca period of transition\u201d and that tariffs might fuel inflation at some point. With consumer confidence showing early signs of weakening, as signaled by recent business surveys, some economists argue that the Federal Reserve may be forced to intervene sooner than expected to stabilize the markets. This idea was already supported by the President, who at some point expressed the opinion that interest rates in the US economy are higher than they should be. The aforementioned developments have caused a market selloff, particularly in previously high-momentum stocks such as the Magnificent 8, which have benefited from the AI megatrend and were responsible for most of the market returns last year. Prior to that, many previously well-performing stocks, such as government contractors, had already lost their momentum following the election results, while some of the few well-performing healthcare stocks were hit by Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement threats. Likewise, the energy sector remained somewhat out of favor \u2013 despite volume tailwinds from Trump 2.0, the expectation of lower oil prices amid a weaker economy has put downward pressure on stock prices in the sector. The key takeaway for investors is that one should look for multibaggers that haven\u2019t yet lost their momentum during the market dip in the last month. These are often lower-capitalization companies that are underfollowed by analysts and operate in high-growth markets.

USGS Acting Director Sarah Ryker said: \u201cThe USGS scans the horizon for future supply chain risks across a broad range of minerals, informing supply chain strategies ranging from mapping domestic mineral resources to recycling and reprocessing mine waste. \u201cThe World Minerals Outlook makes more of that foresight into future trends available publicly for US leaders, other Federal agencies, industry and the public.\u201d US titanium sponge production capacity has also idled, increasing reliance on imports from Japan.

The report also noted that gallium production capacity outside China is expanding, with potential production in Germany, Kazakhstan and South Korea. This initiative follows the Energy Act of 2020 and Executive Order 13817, which defined critical minerals as essential to the US economy and national security. Find out more The World Minerals Outlook, part of the USGS\u2019 broader effort to forecast global mineral supply chains, aims to provide multiyear forecasts of production, consumption and recycling patterns for 50 critical minerals. Mining news and in-depth feature articles on the latest mining company deals and projects covering trends in mineral exploration with up to date data on the most mined metal and mineral commodities The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has released the first World Minerals Outlook assessing global production capacity for seven critical minerals and helium over the next five years. The USGS is also developing scenario analyses to forecast economic impacts of mineral supply disruptions and is mapping critical mineral resources through its Earth Mapping Resources Initiative. The report forecasts that the production capacity of cobalt and lithium, both essential for batteries in mobile devices and electric vehicles (EVs), will double between 2025 and 2029, while the capacity for gallium, palladium, platinum and helium will remain stable. MINE Australia : Mining Technology Focus (monthly) \u00a9 Verdict Media Limited 2025 The report forecasts that the production capacity of cobalt and lithium will double between 2025 and 2029. Additional findings from the report highlight challenges for magnesium projects outside China, which face funding issues, leading to idled capacity. Furthermore, the findings reveal that cobalt production in North America has stalled due to price reductions by China.

Guinigundo said Mr. Duterte\u2019s arrest may affect financial markets in the short term. AP Securities, Inc. Research Head Alfred Benjamin R. Garcia said the current market performance is just a knee-jerk reaction to these events. \u201cThe political instability can erode investor confidence, leading to reduced foreign and domestic investments. This may translate to slow economic growth, as seen historically. This may also result in an unpredictable business environment, which can deter investment and negatively impact corporate profitability,\u201d she said. Aries A. Arugay, chair at the Department of Political Science at the University of the Philippines Diliman, said that Mr. Duterte\u2019s arrest is on track to becoming a \u201ckey electoral issue.\u201d PDEx is expecting to have up to P600 billion in bond listings this year, higher than P360 billion last year. \u2014 with Aubrey Rose A. Inosante and Justine Irish D. Tabile \u201cThe focus of the department is really to actually attract foreign trade and investments and to really grow the industries and to really grow the economy. So that is where we are focused right now,\u201d she added. By Revin Mikhael D. Ochave, Reporter \u201cBut of course we\u2019ll have to see how this situation will develop over the coming weeks,\u201d he said in a Viber message. The midterm elections will be held on May 12. \u201cThere\u2019s an effect because it is seen as political instability. This might scare off foreign investors,\u201d DragonFi Securities, Inc. Equity Research Analyst Jarrod Leighton M. Tin said in a Viber message. \u201cLife goes on. In our case, on the business side, we are very actively trying to attract (business) missions from other countries so that they invest in us, and we export our Filipino products,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. THE ARREST of former Philippine President Rodrigo R. Duterte for crimes against humanity may \u201cdisturb\u201d financial markets as it reflects increasing political instability in the country, analysts said. He said that the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises to Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy (CREATE MORE) Act will help the Philippines attract more foreign investments despite these disruptions. Sought for comment on the issue, Trade Secretary Cristina A. Roque said that the focus right now of the Department of Trade and Industry is to attract foreign investments. Regina Capital Development Corp. Equity Analyst Alexandra G. Yatco said the development is a possible deterrent for investors. CONCERNBDO Capital & Investment Corp. President Eduardo V. Francisco told reporters that the current political situation is a cause of concern for investors. He added that two more listings are expected in March, consisting of the P10-billion bond offer of listed real estate company DoubleDragon Corp. and the P5-billion sustainability-linked bonds of property developer Cebu Landmasters, Inc. \u201cThe ICC arrest could possibly heighten political risk a little bit. We still have yet to see whether the repercussions will spill over to political instability, but I think so far, the government in power right now seem to be monitoring developments and will try to reduce and mitigate political risk as much as it can,\u201d he said during the Money Talks with Cathy Yang program on One News on Wednesday. \u201cWe just hope that there will be less disruptions and we hope that with what has transpired, in the mind of the business sector, we\u2019re still open about being optimistic,\u201d he added. \u201cBusiness will continue. Business will always look at where the country can give you an advantage. I think with CREATE MORE, that gives us broader leeway in attracting foreign investments,\u201d said Mr. Barcelon. \u201cThe investment community and the investors, generally, like stability and peace. Ideally, we wish that all this fighting between the Marcoses and the Dutertes becomes quiet because it\u2019s really causing concerns, even for foreign investors,\u201d he said. \u2018LIFE GOES ON\u2019Meanwhile, the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) Chairman George T. Barcelon said it may be \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d if Mr. Duterte\u2019s arrest will affect business sentiment. Mr. Duterte, who was president from 2016 to 2022, could become the first Asian former head of state to be tried at the ICC. Year-to-date, PDEx has logged P65.7 billion worth of bonds from five listings, Mr. Nakpil said. \u201cShort run, maybe the financial markets will be disturbed. It can be upset,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of the Management Association of the Philippines (MAP) event on Wednesday. \u201cBut over time, over time, people will realize that something can be done here in the Philippines. We don\u2019t tolerate this kind of offenses.\u201d Meanwhile, Philippine Dealing and Exchange Corp. (PDEx) President and Chief Executive Officer Antonino A. Nakpil told reporters in a separate interview that bond listings are expected to continue amid recent political instability. \u201cFor the old regulars, they\u2019ve been through the cycles. Our untold story is actually the power of the domestic investors. They\u2019ve been powering a lot. I\u2019d rather have domestic investors (than foreign investors) because they don\u2019t run away,\u201d he said. Unicapital Securities, Inc. Research Head Wendy B. Estacio-Cruz said in a Viber message there could be increased market volatility as the arrest of a former head of state \u201cis an unprecedented event in the Philippines, introducing a high degree of political uncertainty.\u201d In his presentation during the MAP meeting, Mr. Guinigundo cited the disunity of the \u201cUniTeam\u201d alliance \u2014 between the Marcos and Duterte families \u2014 as one of the domestic risks facing the economy. He also cited food security, and fiscal and debt sustainability as other risks. \u201cThere\u2019s political tension and instability that was triggered by Mr. Duterte\u2019s arrest as well as recession fears by Trump\u2019s tariff policies. This is a potential deterrent for investors to pour their money into the Philippines as investors look for more stable environments,\u201d she said during the Money Talks with Cathy Yang program on One News on Wednesday. Mr. Duterte was flown to The Hague on Tuesday, just hours after he was arrested over a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The former president is facing a case involving alleged crimes against humanity over his anti-drugs crackdown that killed thousands. \u201cIf (the arrest) attracts a big crowd, this is something that would upset and disturb\u00a0the financial markets\u2026 We believe that if this continues, this is something that we really have to be prepared for,\u201d Mr. Guinigundo said.

Reach the largest reinsurance audience. Although insurers have attempted to curb these rising costs by steering patients toward lower-cost care options, such as at-home treatments, the growing number of new drugs in the pipeline for 2025 suggests that pharmaceutical expenses will remain a key challenge for the industry. \u0394 The sharp rise in the number of people taking GLP-1 drugs has further accelerated pharmacy claims, which now represent over 13% of total medical claims. Yet, the health insurance sector as a whole saw a significant drop in underwriting gains, with a 65% decrease to $17.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period the previous year. The report attributes this decline to various factors, including inadequate pricing adjustments in the Medicare Advantage segment. The industry recorded a net income of $31 billion for the period, but increasing medical and pharmaceutical costs have put pressure on profit margins.

Rate hikes needed to adjust for this higher-risk population have been slower than necessary, leading to margin pressures in the Medicaid segment. Looking ahead, AM Best projects that the US health insurance industry will remain profitable through the end of 2024, with similar trends continuing into 2025. \u201cFor the past several years, the industry balanced lower earnings in the commercial segment with steady and increasing profitability in the government program segments, but this trend has reversed as earnings in MA and Medicaid managed care have been challenged while the commercial segment\u2019s premium trend continues to offset the narrowing margins of the several years prior,\u201d added Joseph Zazzera, Director, AM Best. Pricing for 2024 did not sufficiently factor in the uptick in medical costs from 2023 or the increased utilisation of healthcare services. Additionally, regulatory factors\u2014such as changes to Star ratings, risk adjustment payments, and reimbursement rates\u2014are expected to continue pressuring margins in the MA segment through 2025. Pharmaceutical costs also remain a significant concern, driven by an increase in the use of expensive drugs such as biosimilars, gene therapies, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) medications. The report highlights that while the US health insurance industry saw favourable operating performance through the third quarter of 2024, it faced challenges in underwriting, primarily in Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicaid managed care due to rising healthcare costs, particularly in pharmaceuticals.

Reinsurance News Despite cost trends surpassing historical levels, insurers have adjusted their pricing to account for these higher costs. This proactive pricing approach is expected to sustain profitability in the commercial segment through both the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. AM Best, a global credit rating agency focused on the insurance industry, has released its Annual Review & Preview Best\u2019s Market Segment Report, titled \u201cUS Health Insurers Met Challenges in 2024, but Pressures Expected to Persist in 2025.\u201d However, underwriting income is expected to decrease overall, primarily due to weaker results in the Medicare Advantage and Medicaid segments. The commercial segment, however, is expected to remain strong, supported by continued premium growth, the ageing of seniors into Medicare Advantage plans, and rate hikes across various product lines. The commercial health insurance segment, however, performed well in 2023, with a 75% increase in underwriting gains compared to the previous year, fuelled by a rise in premium revenue from the individual market.

During his speech to Congress on March 4, Trump said his tariffs would cause \u201ca little disturbance, but we\u2019re OK with that.\u201d That sounded like a different person than the first-term President Trump, who bragged repeatedly about the economy, whether warranted or not. \u201cWe have talked recently with Washington insiders who think Trump wouldn't mind a recession this year,\u201d Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist for AGF Investments, said in his March 10 newsletter. \u201cThe Democrats \u2014 desperate for an issue \u2014 may have one.\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said recently that the US economy needs a \u201cdetox period,\u201d a concept most economists find perplexing, given that Trump inherited a relatively healthy economy. Bessent says the economy needs more private spending and less reliance on government stimulus, which is generally true. But Congress could fix that gradually through less deficit spending and more prudent budgeting. \u201cDetox\u201d implies uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms that aren\u2019t even necessary, given that there\u2019s no crisis at the moment. Instead, Trump has rolled out tariffs more aggressively than almost anybody expected while showing no concern about unnerving sell-offs in the stock market. Forecasters are now lowering their growth estimates for 2025, raising their inflation estimates, and wondering what in the world Trump is trying to do. Bessent\u2019s marmish admonition is prompting comparisons with Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover\u2019s Treasury Secretary at the beginning of the Great Depression, who advocated severe austerity, no matter how painful, to \u201cpurge the rottenness out of the system.\u201d The Wall Street Journal ran a March 12 analysis suggesting that Trump is taking a similar \u201cliquidationist\u201d approach to the economy by soliciting market failures instead of intervening to stop them. Then during a March 9 Fox News interview, Trump dodged the question when asked if he was expecting a recession this year. \u201cThere is a period of transition,\u201d he said, elliptically. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is very big. It takes time.\u201d Markets bombed the following day, interpreting Trump\u2019s disregard of recession risks as an ominous sign. To reiterate, there were virtually no signs of a looming recession when Biden left office on Jan. 20. In fact, a \u201csoft landing\u201d seemed to be underway in which the Fed wrangled inflation to tolerable levels without choking off spending so much that it caused a recession. The grace period for a new president being able to credibly blame fresh problems on his predecessor is obviously limited, and the sitting president eventually gets all the blame or credit for what happens in the economy. So if Trump truly wants to cause a recession, maybe he should hurry? A \u201cBidencession\u201d narrative is also taking root in Trump-friendly media. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if Joe Biden\u2019s recession shows up,\u201d a Fox News host said on March 7. Yet investors are stunned by the damage Trump has done to the economy in just two months. When Trump took office on Jan. 20, GDP growth was a solid 2.5%, the unemployment rate was a low 4.1%, and stocks were on a nice post-election run-up. Investors expected a \u201cTrump bump\u201d to keep the good times rolling, maybe even enliven the party.

Many investors originally thought Trump would threaten severe tariffs but impose far less stringent measures. That storyline has now lapsed. Trump has aggressively ratcheted up his tariffs, and instead of easing up to give stocks a breather \u2014 the typical pattern during his first trade war in 2018 \u2014 he has basically looked the other way. \u201cYou can\u2019t really watch the stock market,\u201d Trump said on March 10. It\u2019s hard to imagine any normal president trying to deliberately weaken the economy. Recessions are highly unpredictable and even when they\u2019re officially over, high unemployment and depressed living standards can linger for months or years, bringing down any politician they\u2019re associated with. Team Tariff may be signaling that, unlike Trump\u2019s first trade war in 2018 and 2019, they\u2019re not going to let up on tariffs just because markets squeal. The economic \u201ctransition\u201d Trump now envisions seems to be far more sweeping than the limited tariffs that marginally raised prices during his first term. If that\u2019s what he plans, then a painful period of supply chain disruptions, higher prices, lower profits, and possibly layoffs may be necessary to achieve whatever the long-term gain might be.

There\u2019s a more radical corollary: Trump might not even mind tipping the economy into recession early in his term while it\u2019s easier to argue that it\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault. Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Economists don\u2019t see a lot of long-term gain, but they\u2019re already measuring the short-term pain.

Many others, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have cut their growth forecasts but stopped short of predicting a recession.", "https://think.ing.com/articles/expect-robust-semiconductor-demand-in-2025-but-not-in-all-segments/": "ING Global Markets Research Stay up to date with all of ING\u2019s latest economic and financial analysis. Since the second half of 2024, we have observed an inventory correction across automotive supply chains, which typically takes about a year to stabilise. However, the increasing significance of the Chinese market complicates predictions. While Chinese demand exceeded expectations in the latter half of 2024, there are growing indications of oversupply in China, resulting in lower prices. Stay up-to-date Considering the weaker-than-expected earnings season and disappointing 1Q25 guidance, along with signs of inventory build-up and price pressure from China, we hold a more negative outlook on mature technology compared to the WSTS. Additionally, Deepseek demonstrated that advanced AI models can operate with fewer advanced memory chips. Coupled with capacity expansions in the memory segment, this could result in some price pressure. Therefore, we are slightly less optimistic about the growth of the memory market than the WSTS. In 2025, we continue to see the technological advancement of leading-edge memory chips and solid demand for high-bandwidth memory. As Deepseek showed, there is some downside risk to this expectation as data centres may invest a bit less in high-bandwidth memory chips and a bit more on advanced compute chips. However, as data centre investments grow, the future demand for advanced node logic semiconductors looks promising. Our overall expectation for FY25 semiconductor market growth is therefore 9.5%. This remains slightly above the 9% longer-term industry trend growth rate assumed by ASML. Despite the observation that the sentiment in the sector is turning somewhat negative at the moment, the outlook is still rather good for the global semiconductor sector. Nevertheless, since European manufacturers do not focus on leading-edge technology, the continent may not benefit from sector growth. The WSTS (World Semiconductor Trade Statistics), a leading institute, expects global semiconductor market growth of 11.2%. This is below previous forecasts of IDC (15%) and Gartner (12.7%). The WSTS forecasts are driven by 16.8% growth in logic microchips, 13.4% growth in memory microchips and low single-digit growth in mature technology semiconductors. The trend of hyperscale data centres spending more on semiconductors is continuing. According to Gartner, hyperscale data centres spent US$112bn on semiconductors in 2024, almost double the amount the year before. Strong growth is expected to continue. 12 March 2025 The share of electric vehicles in Europe and North America is only slowly rising. Nevertheless, in 2025, the share of electric vehicles will likely approach 50% in China. Therefore, we expect 19% sales growth for electric vehicle sales. In 2025, we expect 9.5% growth in the global semiconductor market, driven\u00a0by robust demand for data centre services, including AI. However, growth in other, more mature segments is expected to be stagnant.\u00a0Our forecast is lower than the projections of WSTS and others, but slightly exceeds ASML's long-term growth expectations for the sector The Covid-19 crisis marked an interesting period in the recent history of the semiconductor industry. There was a high demand for electronics products and therefore semiconductors. This demand was initially difficult to meet, leading to a build-up in semiconductor inventory. These challenges were especially prevalent in the automotive sector, where a shortage of semiconductors led to production delays. What followed was a ramp-up in inventory and a subsequent run-off. Indicators, such as the South Korean semiconductor and parts inventory, suggest that inventory levels have normalised. However, leading industry executives have expressed early concerns about a potential slowdown in the mature market semiconductor segment. The market is becoming increasingly bifurcated, with strong growth in AI and data centre-related segments and stalling growth in more traditional segments, like PCs, smartphones and the automotive sector, driven by semiconductor price pressures. Recent Nvidia results were poorly received, and Samsung has also lowered its outlook for AI-driven demand for its products. Despite this, advancements in AI are progressing rapidly, and growth appears strong. If you are acting in a professional capacity and look for investment research, visit research.ing.com We also expect a drive by data centre operators to develop their own microchips and therefore expect the rise of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Large hyperscale operators look for the most cost-efficient computing power because of the need for cheap AI model inference and some training applications. This can be achieved through tailored ASICs. Companies such as Broadcom and Marvel will help to design the semiconductors, while TSMC will produce them. Over time, these products are expected to take market share from AMD and Intel. Share There is a strong secular trend towards a higher share of semiconductors in cars, which is accelerating with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (BEV/PHEV). However, the overall global automotive market outlook for 2025 is modest, with our automotive analyst projecting a 1.6% growth. Our economic and financial analysis AMD reported FY24 AI chip revenue of more than US$5.0bn and expects AI-driven sales to be in the \u201cstrong double digits\u201d in 2025. AMD expects \u201ctens of billions\u201d of dollars in sales from AI chips in the next couple of years. Nvidia is also confident it can grow sales, especially because of the ramp of its next-generation AI chip (Blackwell). Senior Sector Strategist, TMT Smartphones no longer seem to be the driver of revenue growth in the semiconductor sector. Recent iPhone upgrades were relatively minor compared to previous generations, with the iPhone 16 showing small improvements on the iPhone 15 and disappointing AI capabilities. Also, as global technology market analyst Canalys recently stated, \u201cvendors are facing a tricky 2025 with mounting complexities\u201d. Therefore, the global smartphone market will not be a driver of semiconductor market growth in 2025. Nevertheless, as the market is increasingly driven by high-end products, Samsung and Apple will likely grow their revenues. Given the low growth in the Western world and indications from recent earnings releases, we hope for stable automotive semiconductor markets in 2025. Nevertheless, the automotive semiconductor market is notoriously difficult to predict. Tags TSMC expects \u201cthe revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period\u201d. This is above its overall long-term revenue growth expectation which should approach a 20% CAGR in US dollar terms for the five years starting from 2024.

The reported operating profit margin decreased to 9.8% of sales (2023: 18.3%), primarily due to the negative volume effect, which resulted in missing economies of scale. Cost control measures helped alleviate the impact of lower sales volumes and adverse exchange rate effects. The adjusted EBITDA3 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) for this segment was CHF 79.1 million, compared to CHF 105.5 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.6% of sales, compared to 22.9% in 2023. 2 The calculation of 2024 adjusted net profit and adjusted earnings per share excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 16.4 million) and accumulated amortization of acquired intangible assets (+CHF 19.0 million) and they were calculated with the reported Group tax rate of 13.6%. Adjusted net profit2 was CHF 103.1 million, down from CHF 164.4 million in 2023, when earnings were significantly boosted by a one-time positive effect related to transitional measures from the Swiss tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were CHF 8.08, compared to CHF 12.88 in 2023.

Examples include Tecan's collaboration with Illumina in the Synergence line, supporting their expansion into multi-omics with the development of a new system. Through Paramit, Tecan assisted THINK\u00ae Surgical with the design transfer and initiated the manufacturing of their TMINI\u00ae miniature robotic system, cart, and smart cell charging station. Additionally, Paramit is manufacturing the Avive Connect AED, an innovative and user-friendly automated external defibrillator aimed at improving survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest. The Partnering Business generated sales of CHF 537.3 million in 2024 (2023: CHF 622.6 million or CHF 613.1 million in local currencies), marking a decrease of 13.7% in Swiss francs and 12.4% in local currencies. As anticipated, Tecan did not record any meaningful sales from the pass-through of material costs in this segment for 2024, compared to CHF 8.0 million in 2023. About Tecan Tecan CEO Dr. Achim von Leoprechting commented: \"Tecan is navigating a challenging market environment marked by reduced spending in our target markets, leading to lower demand in both the Life Sciences and Partnering Business segments. These challenges have been compounded by general market weakness in China and specific customer-related factors. In response, we have implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program and optimized our global operations to reinforce our leading position. The long-term trends in healthcare remain unchanged: from life science research to clinical applications, automation and innovation are crucial for scaling healthcare solutions in research, clinical diagnostics, and medtech. This is especially important amid rising healthcare costs, ultimately benefiting people worldwide. With our dedicated team, we are driving exciting innovations and look forward to launching promising new products across both businesses, positioning us well to capitalize on market recovery as conditions improve.\" In 2024, Tecan enhanced its operational resilience by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and continuing to optimize its global organizational footprint. Following the successful transfer of Cavro component production to facilities in Morgan Hill, California, and Penang, Malaysia, and the closure of the San Jose site in 2023, Tecan relocated its genomic reagents site from Redwood City to the expanding Morgan Hill hub at the end of 2024. In Penang, Tecan successfully passed an extensive FDA inspection, laying a strong foundation for future production of medical devices, including class 3 devices. The first medical device production was successfully transitioned to Penang in 2024. Alongside site consolidation, Tecan focused on supply chain optimization and increased vertical integration of manufacturing to leverage the Group's full capabilities and realize cost synergies. Innovation and product launches in the Life Sciences Business In 2024, Tecan demonstrated its commitment to agile cost management amid evolving economic conditions and revenue trends by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and optimizing its global organizational footprint. These efforts are designed to protect profitability without limiting the company's growth potential. As a result, Tecan forecasts an adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding restructuring, acquisition- and integration-related costs, of 17.5-18.5% of sales. Outlook Adjusted EBITDA1 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) was CHF 164.4 million, down from CHF 220.6 million in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 17.6% of sales (2023: 20.5%), aligning with the revised margin outlook of 16-18%. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, as profitability is highly volume-dependent. However, profitability was supported by a comprehensive cost-reduction program. Additionally, exchange rate movements in major currencies against the Swiss franc negatively impacted the margin by approximately 40 basis points. Order entry in the Partnering Business for the full year decreased slightly more than sales as OEM customers adjusted their ordering patterns, shifting from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Despite this shift, the book-to-bill ratio remained close to 1. Further building on sustainability activities Sales of CHF\u00a0934.3 million (2023: CHF\u00a01,074.4 million), down by -13.0% in Swiss francs and by -11.5% in local currencies; H2 sales decrease by -11.3% in local currenciesDecline in sales mainly due to softness in the instrument business with biopharmaceutical companies globally and general market weakness in ChinaAdjusted EBITDA of CHF 164.4 million (2023: CHF 220.6 million), adjusted EBITDA margin reached 17.6% (2023: 20.5%)Margins declined due to lower sales volume, but were partly offset by cost-reduction measuresAdjusted net profit of CHF\u00a0103.1 million (2023: CHF\u00a0164.4 million), adjusted earnings per share of CHF\u00a08.08 (2023: CHF\u00a012.88)Proposal for a stable dividend of CHF 3.00 per share Operating cash flow of CHF 148.5 million (2023: CHF 160.6 million), cash conversion increased to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%) The adjusted EBITDA3 for this segment was CHF 91.1 million, compared to CHF 125.6 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.9% of sales, compared to 20.1% in 2023. M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland, March 12, 2025 - The Tecan Group (SIX Swiss Exchange: TECN) today announced its full set of audited financial results for 2024, underscoring its commitment to enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions. The company also initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025. Proposal for a stable dividend at the Annual General Meeting The full 2024 Annual Report and the 2024 Sustainability Report were also published today and can be accessed on the company's website www.tecan.com under Investor Relations. On the commercial front, Tecan established a direct sales office in South Korea in 2024 by acquiring a long-standing distributor in the region. This new entity includes team members with over 20 years of experience working with Tecan, bringing valuable local market knowledge to better serve this growing market. In 2024, reduced spending in the biopharmaceutical industry led to decreased demand for life science research instruments, affecting both the Life Sciences Business and the Partnering Business. Additionally, a general market weakness in China impacted both direct sales and indirect business through global OEM customers. In the Partnering Business, sales were further influenced by specific customer-related factors, including normalized demand patterns following inventory replenishment by a key customer in 2023. As a result, reported sales for the Group in fiscal year 2024 decreased by 13.0% in Swiss francs, totaling CHF 934.3 million (2023: CHF 1,074.4 million). In local currencies, sales were 11.5% below the prior-year period, aligning with the revised sales outlook from October 2024, which anticipated a decline of 12-14%. Sales in the second half decreased by 12.3% in Swiss francs and by 11.3% in local currencies compared to the prior-year period. These sales results were previously communicated in a trading statement on January 8, 2025. New launches and rich project pipeline in Partnering Business Tecan's 2024 Sustainability Report, published as part of the Annual Report, includes a Climate Risk Scenarios Analysis, highlighting the company's proactive approach to addressing transition and physical risks related to climate change. In preparation for the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Tecan has integrated related data management into its Finance function. For the first time, Tecan's financial auditors conducted a limited assurance audit of key 2024 environmental and social data points. Further progress was made towards greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, with renewable sources accounting for 87% of all electricity purchased. In 2025, Tecan will continue its pragmatic approach to managing risks and opportunities associated with the company's material topics.

Tecan Group www.tecan.com [email\u00a0protected] The outlook 2025 does not take account of potential acquisitions during the course of the year. Tecan also expanded its digital ecosystem with the new Introspect analytics platform, enhancing operational insights and service efficiency. This digital expansion benefits customers across both business segments. The pipeline of new development projects has been further enriched through joint selling of Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit services, targeting key customers in the life sciences, lab diagnostics, and Medtech segments. Tecan aims to double new project signings by 2027 through joint selling efforts, a targeted approach, and strategic account management. The lower demand for life science instrumentation also had a negative impact on the Partnering Business, influencing both the Cavro\u00ae OEM components business and the contract development and manufacturing revenues for life science instruments in the Paramit product line. Market weakness in China also impacted the Cavro OEM components business and sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence\u2122 product line to larger global OEM customers with significant exposure to China. However, outside China, sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence product line developed positively, with increased contributions from newly launched systems. Sales in the Paramit product line, which served medical market customers, were negatively affected by normalized demand patterns following the replenishment of depleted inventories in 2023, when supply chain disruptions eased, and by the anticipated reduction in sales from the pure pass-through of material costs. These impacts were specific to a single customer and included a model transition, rather than being related to end market conditions. All these factors had a more pronounced impact in the second half of the year, when segment sales decreased by 15.9% in local currencies. Tecan (www.tecan.com) improves people's lives and health by empowering customers to scale healthcare innovation globally from life science to the clinic. Tecan is a pioneer and global leader in laboratory automation. As an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Tecan is also a leader in developing and manufacturing OEM instruments, components and medical devices that are then distributed by partner companies. Founded in Switzerland in 1980, the company has 3,300 employees, with manufacturing, research and development sites in Europe, North America and Asia, and maintains a sales and service network in over 70 countries. In 2024, Tecan generated sales of CHF 934 million (USD 1,062 million; EUR 984 million). Registered shares of Tecan Group are traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange (TECN; ISIN CH0012100191). Press Release with financial tables Enhancing operational resilience through cost-reduction initiatives, while expanding global operations and commercial reach Sales in the Life Sciences Business in 2024 reached CHF 397.0 million (2023: CHF 451.8 million or CHF 442.1 million in local currencies), reflecting a decrease of 12.1% in Swiss francs and 10.2% in local currencies. Reduced CAPEX spending by the biopharmaceutical industry globally, along with government and academic customers in the US, resulted in decreased demand for life science research instruments. Additionally, market weakness in China negatively impacted demand, as the announced stimulus program failed to provide any impetus in 2024. Instead, it prompted some customers to delay orders while awaiting funding decisions. Contributing to a more favorable sales development in the Life Sciences Business were recovering consumables sales post-pandemic, a solid service business due to a higher installed base of instruments, and continued strong demand for newly launched products, particularly from genomic diagnostics companies. Recurring sales of services, consumables and reagents increased to 57.6% of segment sales (2023: 52.8%). Attachment 3 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Life Sciences Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 6.4 million). The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Partnering Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 5.3 million). Life Sciences Business (end-customer business) Tecan also reiterated its mid-term outlook, in which the company anticipates returning to average organic growth rates in the mid to high single-digit percentage range in local currencies under normal market conditions, while continuously improving profitability. In the second half of 2024, the Life Sciences Business segment experienced moderate order entry growth in local currencies compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio slightly above 1 for the full year. The overall market environment is showing first signs of stabilization after a significant decline in demand last year, with further improvements expected over the course of 2025.

For 2025, Tecan anticipates that the year will begin with continued softer market conditions, with potential improvement as the year progresses. Depending on the extent of this improvement in the second half, the market could turn slightly positive for the full year, driven by specific growth segments, such as the clinical diagnostics market. Acknowledging the current market conditions, Tecan has initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025, with a full-year guidance range from a low single-digit decline to low single-digit growth in sales in local currencies. The company expects sales in local currencies to decline in the first half, with a softer first quarter and a sequential improvement in the second quarter. A more positive outlook for the second half is supported by a strong reception of newly launched products and partnerships in both divisions, along with additional launches in 2025. Financial results full-year and second half of 2024 Annual Report and Webcast Cash flow from operating activities was CHF 148.5 million, compared to CHF 160.6 million in 2023. Cash conversion improved to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%). Thanks to solid cash flow management, Tecan's net liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term time deposits, less bank liabilities, loans, and the outstanding bond) increased to CHF 153.7 million as of December 31, 2024, up from CHF 112.6 million on December 31, 2023. In 2024, Tecan advanced its product portfolio with significant launches in genomics, proteomics, and cell biology. Examples include the Resolvex i300 module, introduced in February, which enhances throughput in proteomics by integrating with the Fluent\u00ae platform, and the Spark Cyto 3D, which supports drug discovery by enabling the analysis of complex 3D cell models. During a Capital Markets Day in October 2024, Tecan previewed Veya\u2122, a multi-omics liquid handling workstation that simplifies lab automation and boosts productivity. Officially launched at the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (SLAS) international conference in San Diego, USA, in January 2025, Veya provides effortless automation by overcoming key barriers in lab automation. In the second half of the year, sales declined by 5.0% in local currencies, following the sharp 15.5% decline in the first half. Sequentially, the Life Sciences Business segment grew by 13.6% in local currencies when comparing the second half of 2024 to the first half.

The Partnering Business segment was impacted by a shift in OEM customer ordering patterns, moving from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Meanwhile, the Life Sciences Business segment saw moderate order entry growth in local currencies in the second half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

Trump then confirmed that the \"strong man in Canada\" - referring to Ford, who also earlier threatened to cut off electricity exports to the US - has suspended his own tariff plans. But how much electricity does the US import from Canada ? The White House says Trump's plans for a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium will still take effect on Wednesday - \"with no exceptions or exemptions\". Manufacturing job numbers are strong, andforeign investments are up. We just heard from Ontario's leader Doug Ford, who announced at the top of his news conference that he has agreed to temporarily pause a 25% surcharge to electricity his province sends to 1.5 million American homes, after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick extended an \"olive branch\". As a reminder: Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. The companies that bring the goods into the country pay the tax to the government Warren notes that this second Trump administration is different from his first, which also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium back in 2018. They were rolled back the following year. The White House posture towards Canada is starkly different to the stance on Mexico, which has also faced the threat of tariffs. \"I think he [Doug Ford] kind of understood that this was not going to be a fight,\" Navarro says. \"I've encouraged our friends in Canada to keep the rhetoric down.\" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad they listened\" in a post on social media, after Canada's Doug Ford announced a pause on plans to end his territory's energy exports to some US states. 15:35 pm Trump says he's \"looking at\" walking back the additional hikes and \"could make a different decision\" The red maple leaf Canadian flag hung everywhere in sight. One other notable soundbite from that news conference with Ontario Premier Ford. The original 25% tariffs will still go into effect on Wednesday, Lutnick says. Trump to 'probably' cut Canada tariffs after Doug Ford's reversal According to Electricity Canada, external, a trade association for Canadian energy suppliers, the US imports electricity from its neighbour because it makes sense for affordability. Edited by Caitlin Wilson and Alys Davies Trump had earlier suggested a reversion to 25% tariffs could happen today. But in the intervening hours, economic threats and then rollbacks have flown back and forth across the US-Canadian border all day. Tuesday's tariff back-and-forth comes after the worst day of 2025 for US markets, fuelled by fears of President Trump's aggressive tariffs on America's biggest trading partners He told reporters: \"You can't attack your number one customer, Canada, and not expect a response.\" After President Trump entered the roundtable event and made his opening remarks, the media present appear to have been asked to leave shortly after he began answering questions. Just recently, for example, Trump said he had a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat relationship\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whom the Washington Post this week dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest Trump whisperer\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The rollback comes after the Canadian province of Ontario said it would temporarily suspend its plan to charge a 25% tariff on electricity it sends to northern US states But then by this afternoon, both parties had stepped back from these vows. Just hours before, hundreds of ordinary Canadians made their voices heard outside Parliament.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not for sale!\" one sign read. \"Not a 51st anything,\" another poster said, held high. Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House Charging some of its closest allies and trade partners more to import goods might seem counterintuitive for the US. \"If you're a stock market investor and you understand Trumponomics, you will be bullish, and you won't fall prey to daily volatility and get fleeced by day traders,\" Navarro added. Trump said the tariffs will begin on Wednesday, adding that he'll declare \"a national emergency on electricity\" in those states That reversal came after US President Trump had said he would double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium from 25% to 50% in retaliation to the Ontario threat Additionally, while Navarro said the transition to \"Trumponomics\" could be a \"little bumpy\", he said the administration was confident. Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent While President Donald Trump has hinted he might consider cutting back on the 50% tariffs he's announced on Canadian steel and aluminium, plans are currently still in place to bring in 25% tariffs on these materials from midnight on Wednesday for several countries. The entire political landscape has changed in Canada. With Donald Trump's tariffs and threats, Canadians have rallied around their flag. Economic warningsigns are just a \u00e2\u0080\u009csnapshot in time\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Ford says that when someone extends an \"olive branch\", he would thank them for the opporutnity. That short memory ultimately may end up helpingTrump and his team, however, if their trade and government-slashing plans doeventually lead to the kind of growth they have promised. Trump said he's \"looking at it\" and could \"make a different decision\". 13:45 pm White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calls Ontario's threat to shut down electricity imports to the US \"egregious and insulting\". When asked if the US still considers Canada a close ally, she says they \"might be a competitor now\" When Ontario\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader Doug Ford announced the 25% surcharge on electricity exports, he suggested that the measure would impact 1.5 million homes and businesses across the northern states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York. Just a few days ago, I was in the room as Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liberal Party gathered to elect its next leader on Sunday. With the US president's warnings from across the border, the anti-Trump feeling in the room was palpable. Earlier, Navarro said Ford was a \"politician in Canada\" rather than an economist. The relocation of industry to the US is a \"bigger win\" than the money being brought in by the tariffs, he said. President Trump is now meeting the CEOs of America's largest companies for a roundtable discussion, where the current economic situation is sure to be top of the agenda. Doug Ford suspends electricity surcharge until meeting with US American voters tend to have short memories,however, and blaming current conditions on a president who left office inJanuary is unlikely to fly for long \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly when economic uncertaintyhas been exacerbated by Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own actions. He spoke briefly about tariffs, saying they're having a \"tremendously positive impact\". Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the out outsiders pay\u00e2\u0080\u009d - a proposal the president has dubbed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cExternal Revenue Service\u00e2\u0080\u009d. He said the country had responded to US tariffs and the next step was to negotiate. In response, Trump had also threatened to double the rate of aluminium and steel tariffs on Canada from 25% to 50%. He has also since walked back on this threat. \"If there's anybody out there threatening my home, I want to be a part of the fight against that,\" one woman told us. Alex LedermanUS reporter President Donald Trump blamed the province of Ontario's now-rescinded move to place a 25% surcharge on electricity heading into the US as the reason for his now-cancelled decision to double steel and aluminium tariffs. Lutnick announced that he and Ford have agreed to meet in Washington on Thursday ahead of Trump's 2 April deadline for reciprocal tariffs. \"I respect that,\" Trump said. Calling himself a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbusinessperson\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he said he wanted to find a solution to \u00e2\u0080\u009cstop the bleeding\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Our feed has been cut. Online feeds run by other outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Fox, have also been turned off. He adds his union members are not only concerned about tariffs, but also the sovereignty of Canada as US President Donald Trump repeats his desire to make Canada \"the 51st state.\" The other countries listed in his executive order, external signed in February include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, EU countries, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the UK. It's rare to see a White House news conference in any administration where a US ally is spoken about in the tone used today with regard to Canada, even in periods when officials in Washington have clearly been exasperated with their partners abroad. He claimed car companies have relocated their manufacturing from Mexico to the US. He also accused China of owning the plants being built in Mexico, adding that tariffs had put a stop to that now. For instance, it says, Canadians tend to use more electricity during winter for heating, while demand in the US is higher during the summer, when it is needed for cooling. Congressionalelections aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until November 2026, and this is still early in Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secondterm. As President Trump escalated his trade war withCanada and US stocks rode a rollercoaster, White House presssecretary Karoline Leavitt painted an upbeat picture earlier today. Jessica MurphyReporting from Toronto 12:40 pm Ford says he will meet with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, adding that shutting off electricity to various northern US states is the \u00e2\u0080\u009clast thing\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wants to do 14.05 pm The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says that without its country's exports, \"the US won't have enough of either metal to satisfy the needs of its demanding economy\", suggesting Trump's promised \"golden era\" would therefore not be possible 14:50 pm Ford says he will suspend the electricity surcharge after Lutnick reached out to him in a phone call with an \"olive branch\", adding that he will be headed to Washington on Thursday to negotiate with the US trade secretary and is \"pretty confident\" Trump will back down on the additional tariff hikes \"Our members are scared,\" Warren of the United Steelworkers tells the BBC. Earlier on Tuesday, the union said the tariffs would be an \"industry killer\" that would lead to job losses. \"All you folks have seen how President Trump has changed things on a daily basis,\" Ford said. \"I don't want to wait until April 2,\" when Trump said reciprocal tariffs would kick in, Ford said. We've just heard a response from Donald Trump following Doug Ford's reversal on imposing a 25% tariff on electricity flowing from his province to northern US states. Meanwhile, Trump is meeting a group of business CEOs in Washington DC Before the media left the room, Trump made some wide-ranging opening remarks at the business roundtable event, covering everything from ceasefire negotiations regarding the war in Ukraine to the success of Doge. Ford added that China was sitting back and laughing at the US and Canada's trade spat. 10:30 am Trump announces an additional 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminium in retaliation to Doug Ford's Monday electricity surcharge threat, bringing the import fee to 50% Head spun? Here's an approximate timeline of how it all went down, in Eastern Daylight Time: All eyes will now be on a meeting that is set to take place between Ford and Lutnick. That will happen on Thursday in Washington, according to Lutnick. Among those in attendance will be Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc. Senior White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has confirmed that the administration has reversed plans to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium. 12:25 pm When asked why Mexico wasn't facing the same fees, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded: \"We're respectful\" The White House says Donald Trump has delivered \"a win for the American people\", after Ontario Premier Doug Ford dropped his threat to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the US. Trump himself declined to rule out the possibility of a recession in an interview with Fox News last week, saying: \"I hate to predict things like that\" after acknowledging that his policies will bring about a period of transition. 13:55 pm Canada's next Prime Minister Mark Carney posts on social media, calling the new tariff hike \"an attack\u00e2\u0080\u009d, saying his government will \"ensure our response has maximum impact in the US and minimal impact here in Canada\" The market drop signals anxiety on the part of investors, who worry that the tariffs could trigger an economic slowdown or cause a recession. \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win,\" the newly selected party leader Mark Carney told a roaring crowd.Polls showed a huge bounce back from near-certain defeat to the Conservatives in the coming general election. Warren says that his union has been in discussions with its US counterpart to send a message that these tariffs stand to hurt both American and Canadian workers. Earlier today, President Trump threatened to double tariffs he planned to impose tomorrow on Canadian steel and aluminium in response to Ontario's electricity hike. This afternoon, after Ford spoke, Trump said he could cut back on import duties. Trump has also said he wants to raise money for the government through the fees. White House officials say the US will impose 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, rather than the 50% Donald Trump announced earlier The trade association says that cross-border trade in electricity works by allowing regions to coordinate with neighbours to draw on each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surplus supplies when excess electricity isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being used, therefore keeping costs down and avoiding overbuilding. At one point, Leavitt recited statistics on the cost of living in major Canadian cities, saying their residents would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetter served\u00e2\u0080\u009d if, as Trump has suggested, Canada becomes the 51st state of the US. Tensions quickly flared between Ford and Trump on Tuesday, after Ford said he would \"not hesitate\" to stop supplying the US with electricity in response to Trump's tariffs, and Trump in turn said Canada would pay a price \"so big it will be read about in history books for years to come\". It seems the day will end as it began on the tariffs front - with the US planning to impose a 25% surcharge on steel and aluminium imported from Canada, as well from everywhere else in the world, starting at midnight. There is plenty of time to bounce back. Butevery day on this current trajectory means the political hole the president isdigging gets deeper, whether Leavitt acknowledges that from the White Housepodium or not. Marty Warren, the national director for the union representing steelworkers in Canada, tells the BBC the on-again-off-again threats of tariffs from the US on his industry are \"reckless\" and have been a cause of major anxiety for workers. A once-dejected Liberal Party felt rejuvenated. With a trade war looming and a widespread feeling that Canadian sovereignty could be under threat, the party had a newfound sense of purpose. Ford cautioned that Ontario still has electricity as a bargaining chip. But he said that he would not deny an opportunity to sit down with the Americans and let \"cooler heads prevail\". \"We're relying on allies. Some won't speak up,\" he acknowledges. \"Some will, but we're trying to work closely and lobby the people that we think we can get a message through.\" Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2025 BBC.

Yesterday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity sent from the province to the US, threatening to \"shut off electricity completely\" if the US were to further escalate the ongoing trade war. Trump retaliated by doubling the US's upcoming 25% global steel and aluminium tariffs to 50% for Canada. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you need to know: According to the province's Premier Doug Ford, negotiations between his province and the Trump administration are ongoing, with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick inviting Ford to Washington In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25% surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota, Lutnick said. Canadian Minister Stephen Lecce has also claimed that Canada sells 12,000 megawatts of power into the US market each day, and is a \u00e2\u0080\u009c30 times net exporter\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the US - \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey need our power\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he says. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has just finished speaking to the press in Toronto after a back and forth over tariffs between the US and Canada. In addition to senior US trade adviser Peter Navarro, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has now also confirmed that the White House will no longer impose 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, according to the BBC's US media partner, CBS news. Setbacks are only \u00e2\u0080\u009ctemporary\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \"President Trump has once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world,\" the statement says. And to whatever extent there are problems with theUS economy, it is because of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. But by making imports more expensive, Trump is hoping to stoke demand for US-made goods, helping to boost domestic manufacturing. \"Trump said he would take Canada through economic means,\" he says. \"This constant threat, this constant disrespect for Canadians and Canada's sovereignty is what makes it different.\" Nadine YousifReporting from Toronto The 25% tariffs on aluminium and steel will still be enforced. 16:50 pm White House officials Lutnick and Peter Navarro confirm Trump has reversed his plans to double the steel and aluminium tariffs to Canada to 50%, and say the 25% tariff will go into effect as scheduled at midnight for Ottawa and the rest of the world US steel and aluminium imports from a number of countries, including Canada, its biggest steel supplier, will be taxed at a minimum of 25%. Canadians - usually stereotyped for being so polite - were ready for a fight. The meeting comes as US stock markets plummeted in response to Trump's threats of tariffs on neighbouring Canada and Mexico, as well as other nations. \"God only knows\" what would happen between now and that deadline, he said. Much of today's tariff discussion was centred around Canadian energy imports to the United States. Around 100 business leaders are expected to be in attendance at the regular meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, DC. Those in the room will include the CEOs of Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Walmart. It's been a hectic Tuesday for North American trade, with threats of fees on imported goods flying back and forth between the US and Canada like a ping pong ball. The president tells reporters at the White House that he's now considering cutting back on the 50% tariffs he announced earlier on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Navarro says the change happened after Ontario's Premier Doug Ford backed down from his electricity surcharge, which Navarro described as \"sounding ominous\".", "https://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-prepares-tariff-cut-plan-for-us-trade-deal-36494.html/": " Trade between the two countries has seen a steady rise in recent years.

Banks Or IT: Which Stocks Should You Buy Now? | Sectors To Watch | IT Stocks | Stock Market", "https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/2025/03/12/upcoming-election-shore-construction-activities/": " With interest rates now slightly reduced from the 7 per cent high seen since February of last year, the central bank, which has been making adjustments to keep unstable inflation in line with its 4-6 per cent targeted range, many complain is not being done fast enough. In contrast to the current 6 per cent rate, the Bank of Jamaica had for a few quarters since 2019 consistently held interest at a historic low of 0.50 per cent and this helped to fuel the strong post-COVID growth seen for the sector. Despite these increased activities, the vulnerable sector, which remains under new threat he said, is also now called to pay close attention to trade developments in the US and how they are likely to further weigh on output, if any at all. \u201cHowever, fortunate for us, our customers have been very loyal and sales have continued to hold steady,\u201d Barnes stated. The hardware distributor, following the recent launch of a $500-million initial public offering (IPO), set to close on March 13, the managing director said, will be using some of the funds raised to build up its capital base as it increase operational efficiencies across the business and diversify product offerings. Additionally, the total value of mortgages disbursed by the NHT over the October to December reporting period, the entity said, declined by 24.2 per cent to total $6.2 billion. For the other construction component, fallouts were driven by a decline in capital expenditure on civil engineering activities largely due to the winding down of roadwork activities associated with the South Coast Highway Improvement Project (SCHIP), as well as the impact of weather-related events, which hindered ongoing work. Reduced disbursements by the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) over the period also negatively impacted output from the sector. HOUSE RULES \u201cA further contraction in the other construction component was tempered by increased disbursement by NROCC, which disbursed $2.8 billion, up 34.9 per cent relative to the corresponding quarter of 2023. Expenditure during the review period was primarily for the Montego Bay Perimeter Road and the Southern Coast Highway Improvement Project (SCHIP),\u201d the PIOJ data however noted. The work being executed in phases has already seen the roll-out of Work Order 1 which had projects spanning some 21 constituencies and eight parishes, including the corporate area. Work Order 2, which covered an additional four roads across 21 constituencies, saw projects commencing in late February, while activities under Work Order 3, which comprises another 42 roads across 21 additional constituencies, was scheduled to have begun at the start of this month. Crediting the agility of Atlantic\u2019s business, the company, he said, has, despite the softness of the market, been able to record double-digit growth year on year. The Gvernment\u2019s $45-billion Shared Prosperity through Accelerated Improvement to our Road Network (SPARK) Programme, lined up as that to which he refers, works minister Robert Morgan said should see upgrades being done on approximately 100 of the island\u2019s thoroughfares. Projects under the programme are targeted for completion before the end of the 2024/25 fiscal year. The sector, Barnes said, continues to be adversely impacted by relatively high interest rates, he blames this as one of the major inhibitor of growth. \u201cThe fall-off in the building construction component was due mainly to the performance of the residential category, reflected in a 19.0 per cent downturn in housing starts by the National Housing Trust (NHT),\u201d preliminary estimates of economic performance released last month by the entity revealed. \u201cWe anticipate that with the elections due this year, the Government will embark on a major capital expenditure programme which will redound to increase activities in the sector,\u201d he told the Jamaica Observer. \u201cThe SPARK Programme should act as a fillip to the sector and bolstered by these activities our team anticipates moderate growth in the domestic construction sector,\u201d Barnes said to the Business Observer. \u201cMortgage rates are still at elevated levels, consequently, reducing an effective demand for house loans. Unfortunately, despite the reductions by the central bank, financial institutions have also been much slower in adjusting their own rates and whilst we are cognisant of the \u2018lag effect\u2019 in the financial sector, we are still concerned that rates are still at an elevated level,\u201d Barnes said. The local construction sector, after benefiting from back-to-back quarters of robust growth since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, has in the last two years suffered from a wave of setbacks brought on by high interest rates, reduced real estate activity and a general trimming of capital expenditure projects. According to data released by the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ), the sector, which saw a 2.1 per cent contraction during the last quarter of 2024, continued to experience significant downturn in both the building construction, and other construction components. Up to the end of the company\u2019s nine-month period in 2024, total revenues stood at $1.2 billion. After almost two years of downturns, the local construction industry is expected to benefit from increased activities with a slew of infrastructural projects scheduled to come on stream in the lead-up to the general election due by September of this year. \u201cIt is too early to have a definitive perspective on the imposed tariffs by the US on certain countries; however, we are watching the developments closely,\u201d Barnes said. According to industry player and managing director of Atlantic Hardware and Plumbing Company Deanall Barnes, the sector, though blighted by a mix of challenges, should see some offshoots of growth in the coming months as Jamaicans get ready to go to the polls.", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-tariffs-spark-trade-34844502": "The EU vowed today to respond with a series of its own measures this morning, as has Canada, while the UK is so far taking the tariff impact on its chin. The Government has been urged to act as the tariffs hit British steel, but an expert has warned that doing so could doubly harm the economy when it is already in a fragile state. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters this morning the bloc was hoping to \"explore better solutions with the US\" after ordering $28 billion (\u00a321.6 billion) tariffs on US goods from next month. She said: \"We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geoeconomic and political uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with such tariffs.\" The sizeable new tariffs, seen as a bid to by the Commander-in-Chief to reorder trade in his favour, are the latest in a series of border-hopping punitive financial measures designed by Trump to redress so-called \"bad deals\". He believes the US is ultimately losing out on the world's stage, and is now aiming to renegotiate and renege - but has come under fire from allies he has targeted. \"We\u2019re incredibly disappointed that the US has decided to take this course of action and we will continue to work with steel companies and the UK Government to deliver the best possible outcome for our members and our industry.\" But Dr Foucart warned that retaliatory measures may doubly hurt the economy, hitting both exporters and consumers. \"But they have an advantage: they seem to help Trump find his senses, as evidence by the flurry of announcements and cancellation of tariffs.\" While the costs are mounting for the country in the middle of a fight for its life, Dr Foucart said the most significant impact would be the ongoing western trade war. He said: \"I would say the main impact is that trade wars between Western partners (the EU, Canada, the US) play in the hands of Russia, by making us all poorer and less united. And perhaps less focused on our joint support for Ukraine.\" Mr Trump's tariffs have been strapped to all US imports, meaning British steel hasn't been spared from the order despite the seemingly positive relationship shared by the President and PM Keir Starmer. The UK steel industry is a relatively small proportion of the country's GDP, contributing around \u00a32billion to the UK economy in 2020 and representing around 0.1 percent of total economic output. EU members Germany, Ireland and Italy, all of which have a trade surplus with the US, are anticipating the most significant impact from the tariffs. In 2023, Germany's surplus was worth \u20ac57 billion (\u00a347.9 billion), with Ireland's worth \u20ac50 billion (\u00a342.1 billion) and Italy's \u20ac41 billion (\u00a334.5 billion). The latest round of tariffs - which were imposed the night before the global steel tariffs activated - were ordered on steel and aluminium, with an additional 25 percent added to the existing 25 percent rate, bringing it to 50 percent. The move was a reaction to previously Trump-supporting Ontario governor Doug Ford's move to respond to Mr Trump with a 25 percent tariff on electricity from his state. Those nations stand to lose the most financially, especially Mexico, for which steel exports to the US are worth the most - around $4.3 billion (\u00a33.3 billion). Other nations, namely the EU, while exporting less, have decried Mr Trump's move as damaging for global trade and international relations. Get email updates with the day's biggest stories Canadian leaders have repeatedly against tariffs coming from the US, any of which would prove nationally devastating thanks to the country's massive economic stakes. The US is Canada's largest trading partner, with the World Integrated Trade Solution estimating a huge 76.8 per cent share of its international exports going south of the border in 2022. The EU duties aim for pressure points in the US while minimizing additional damage to Europe. The tariffs - taxes on imports - primarily target Republican-held states, hitting soybeans in House speaker Mike Johnson's Louisiana, but also beef and poultry in Kansas and Nebraska. Produce in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia is also on the list. The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on US industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to 25 percent. The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the US tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Many countries hit by the tariffs have resolved to respond with rounds of their own against the US, and representatives for Brit workers have advised the UK government to do the same. Mr McDiarmid recommended the UK should respond with appropriate \"defence measures\", including \"at the very least\", matching the tariffs. Canada has emerged as one of Mr Trump's chief targets during his latest terms, with the US President seemingly keen to have the nation become the \"treasured\" 51st state. He has independently levelled and rescinded tariffs on his country's vital trade partner neighbour, from which it imports the most steel. The Ukrainian Steel Association warned in February, weeks before the tariffs came into effect, that import duties could cost the war-weary industry about 2.4billion hryvnias (\u00a342.7million) in revenue and the government 1billion hryvnias (\u00a317.7million) in taxes per year. Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister of Australia, said the tariffs went \"against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship\". Australia will not level tit-for-tat duties, but said those imposed on his country were \"a form of economic self-harm, and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation\". Dr Foucart said the affected nations would likely take a specific message from the experience and ensure global production is not too dependant on a single financial partner. He said: \"The main message every country will take home from this is that our production cannot be too dependent from inputs from a single partner. He said: \"Manufacturing today is based on deeply interconnected supply chains. This means that any tariff on material such as steel or aluminium makes production more expensive for everyone. For instance, if a US car manufacturer needs to pay 25 percent more to buy steel, this will reflect immediately on the price of cars.\" The US imports more steel from Canada than any other country, according to the US Department of Commerce, having received six million tonnes from its immediate neighbour in 2024. Brazil and Mexico, the other US neighbour, come in second and third on the tariff table, exporting 4.1 and 3.2 milion tonnes to the country respectively. He said: \"The UK\u2019s response must include delivering a robust Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the strongest possible trade defence measures to shield our sector from diverted imports. At a minimum we must at least match any measures taken by the EU. Alasdair McDiarmid, the Assistant General Secretary for steelworker's union Community, said the tariffs will prove \"hugely damaging\" and threaten jobs, adding it would also blow back on the US. He said: \"These US tariffs on UK steel exports are hugely damaging and they threaten jobs. For the US it\u2019s also self-defeating, as the UK is a leading supplier of specialist steel products required by their defence and aerospace sectors.\" Donald Trump's trade war came to Europe this morning as the deal-seeking US President activated his 25 percent steel and aluminium tariffs - further destabilising the global economy. Dr Renaud Foucart, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Lancaster, told the Mirror UK manufacturing - which represents nearly 20 percent of the UK's GDP - would become more expensive. He said: \"While the EU and Canada seem to go for the 'retaliation' approach, adding their own counter measures to the US import taxes (tariffs), the UK may choose to try to weather the storm. Retaliation hurts your economy again: your exporters struggle due to US import taxes, and your own consumers and producers struggle due to domestic import taxes. \"This is what Europe is trying to do by \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China. And China by trying to reduce its dependency on exporting to the US. This implies we do not always choose the cheaper product but also think in terms of economic autonomy. Higher prices for everyone, but higher resilience also.\" In 2013, the UK produced 5.6million tonnes of steel, a tiny 0.3 percent of the global total. While the proportion of trade is low, the industry is spread across around 1,100 UK businesses, which support 40,000 jobs. These are expected to be directly threatened by the tariffs. He added the overarching trade wars would have a \"bad\" impact, saying price increases across the supply chain would mean \"we will all suffer\". Steel exports make up a much larger proportion of Ukraine's economy, making up 14.6 percent of exports and 5.7 percent of the country's total GDP. In 2023, figures showed that steel made up 57.9 percent of the country's exports to the US, suggesting it will suffer from Trump's latest orders.", "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trumps-economy-the-reagan-story-or-the-biden-story/": "But after that, the economy began to recover and then boom. Inflation and unemployment both fell. By 1984, the annual growth rate was the highest in 34 years. Between 1983 and 1989, the U.S. added the equivalent of Japan\u2019s whole economy to its GDP. Reagan was reelected in a 49-state landslide. He was fewer than one vote per precinct in Minnesota, his Democratic challenger\u2019s home state, away from sweeping all 50. The tariffs are less targeted than during the first term, and their status is changing frequently. This time the tariffs, rather than tax cuts (which Congress still needs to extend) or deregulation, is dominating the coverage of the Trump agenda. And Elon Musk actually wants to cut spending. Trump has always had other issues besides the economy, such as immigration, anti-wokeness, and general resistance to the left on the culture war. On those, he still retains an upper hand. But for the first time since the height of the pandemic, people are feeling anxious about a Trump-led economy. The stock market and other indexes of economic confidence are down. As the Federal Reserve tightened the money supply to put the screws to inflation, largely with Reagan\u2019s support despite the chairman having been appointed by Jimmy Carter, the economy did initially get worse. There was a recession in 1982, during which unemployment reached 10.8 percent, the highest since the Great Depression. Republicans lost seats in the midterm elections that year. While Trump wants to be associated with general prosperity, a \u201cgolden age\u201d even, his ambitions were always greater than restoring the economy of 2019. He wants to reindustrialize vast swathes of the country and reshore American jobs. Many, perhaps most, economists believe that Trump has bitten off more than he can chew. The Reagan economic legacy, and especially its relevance to public policy in subsequent times, remains hotly debated today. But the bottom line is that a lot of dire predictions either failed to come to fruition or were short-lived and stagflation ended. That sentiment prevailed on election day, according to the exit polls, with Trump winning 81 percent of voters who listed the economy as their top issue, 70 percent among those who rated the economy as poor or not so good, and 88 percent of voters who said it was just poor. Of course, it is possible that none of the historical analogies favored by those of us who write about politics for a living will describe what happens under Trump. But he surely prefers the story of the man whose picture he hung in the Oval Office to that of the man he ousted from the premises. Donate Today: At least some voters came to understand that the economic downturn of 2020 was caused mainly by the lockdowns, of which Trump was at best a reluctant adopter. They wanted their pre-pandemic economy back. Polls consistently showed Trump was trusted to do a better job handling the economy than Biden or Kamala Harris. Economic turmoil isn\u2019t insurmountable\u2014but, badly managed, it can be politically fatal. This is not a paywall.All our content remains freely accessible. If the economy of Trump\u2019s first term, with low unemployment, low inflation, and solid GDP growth, had continued through election day, in retrospect it is clear that he would have been reelected. Not by a landslide, but probably by a margin similar to what he achieved last November. Alas, the pandemic\u2014and Anthony Fauci\u2014intervened and aborted the Trump boom. But as the Joe Biden interregnum wore on, voters developed a nostalgia for the economy of circa 2019. Inflation began spiking, soon reaching 9.1 percent, a 41-year high. The economy still grew most quarters and unemployment remained low by historical standards, even if the jobs market was often less rosy than it initially appeared as the numbers were revised downward. But the high cost of living eroded whatever advantages accrued from other, more positive economic metrics. That was said of Ronald Reagan, too. Passing a big tax cut in a period of inflation worse than under Biden was viewed as pouring gasoline on an already roaring fire. Most economists believed there was an inherent tradeoff between cutting inflation and unemployment, which Reagan rejected. And there was an attempt to cut federal spending and personnel, beginning with the firing of striking air traffic controllers. Your support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism. With your contribution, we can maintain our commitment to principled reporting on the issues that matter most. Unfortunately for Trump, that is not the only possible historical analogy. There is a more recent one. Biden was warned that continuing to increase federal spending, especially as the pandemic was ending and people were already returning to work, would pour gasoline on a then just smoldering inflationary fire. That is exactly what happened, and the problem was far from \u201ctransitory.\u201d His presidency was basically ruined in its first months, and Trump was later returned to office. That\u2019s the story Carville would rather tell about his candidate, anyway. W. James Antle III is executive editor of the\u00a0Washington Examiner magazine and a contributing editor of The American Conservative. The economy has long been a top issue, though far from the only issue, for Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s business acumen, entrenched in the voters\u2019 minds through a decades-long public relations blitz culminating in a star reality TV turn, was a major reason the electorate was willing to entrust the presidency to a political neophyte. James Carville\u2019s political instincts remain sharp, though he is not as in tune with the current political moment as he was 33 years ago. Still, you could do worse as a political maxim than \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid!\u201d", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/03/12/us-deportees-haiti-gangs-police-targets-prison/81766301007/": "Kivland called for a public information campaign, both in Haiti and in the United States, to counter misunderstandings about deportees who are perceived as violent criminals, when in fact many have been deported after minor offenses, she said. For some deportees, problems started as soon as soon as they landed in Haiti on flights chartered by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Haitian authorities routinely imprisoned deportees who had criminal convictions in the U.S. and extorted relatives for thousands of dollars, The Record revealed in a 2022 investigation. One deportee, Roody Fogg of Florida, died of cholera while detained during an outbreak in prison. Now, finally freed, he knew no one. In November, police in an armored vehicle shot and wounded Shyler Registre, a deportee, as he walked through a park near the National Palace, Karshan said. No one came to his aid, and a health clinic asked for an \"exorbitant amount\" that he could not pay. In December, police detained Edzer Rene, a deportee living in Port-au-Prince. His body was found in the street a few weeks later, Karshan said. \"The Haitian government, including prime ministers and presidents, have denounced the criminal deportees, saying they are a big threat,\" said Michelle Karshan, executive director of Alternative Chance, a support program for criminal deportees in Haiti. Haiti is facing extreme violence, he said. Gangs have set up tolls along the roads and demanded payment from passerby, crippling transport of goods and making travel dangerous for all, including deportees, O'Neill added. The 21 were held in a crowded cell with no beds, no provisions and forced to use the travel monies they were given, which equals $38, to buy food and water, Karshan said. Discrimination and vigilantism grew as gang violence escalated across Haiti, Karshan said. Police have targeted criminal deportees \u201cnot in the act of a crime.\" The law clinic, in consultation with human rights groups, called for ending deportations to Haiti and granting asylum to those who could face jailing or persecution in Haiti. The U.S. must also ensure deportees are not imprisoned and take steps to end abuses, such as public anti-discrimination campaigns, the report states. Peterson said Haiti should have support programs and shelters for deportees. Some have been in the U.S. for so long that they don't speak the language or have connections there. After eight months in a packed prison teeming with heat, disease and hunger, Peterson Rosier should have felt free. Instead, he felt fear. Haitian police pursued him after his release, asking for more money and even trying to re-arrest him, Julney said. He moved eight times until he finally fled to the Dominican Republic. The University of Miami School of Law Human Rights Clinic also called on the United States in a 2023 report to act to ensure deportees' human rights are respected. The criminal deportees are seen \"as killers,\" and that \"they should be detained when they first arrive to teach them a lesson,\" Karshan said. Many have lived in the United States since childhood and stand out because of their speech and appearance, from tattoos to hairstyles. Chelsey Kivland, an associate professor of anthropology at Dartmouth College, said discrimination has included \"not renting a property, not offering employment and not welcoming one into the community,\" said Kivland, whose research is focused on Haiti. If they don't have family or friends in Haiti, she said, they are at risk of social abandonment. At the park, two police officers arrested Rosier and detained him overnight, accusing him of gang involvement. \u201cIf they have family or support networks in the capital, how do they get back?\" he said. \"The FAA just announced no U.S. airplanes until September using the main international airport of the country, so they land in Cap-Haitien. How are they going to get back and what do they face in the capital, with violence and shortages of everything, and a million already displaced?\u201d Bernabe was deported in April 2022, after serving two years for drug possession. He also was promptly imprisoned and pressured to pay thousands in fees, a burden that fell on his family. He found shelter with relatives in Haiti, but some did not want him around and asked that he not visit their homes. Asked about reported abuses against deportees, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said, \"We are working with receiving countries to facilitate a humane response.\u00a0 We refer you to the receiving country\u2019s government authorities for further information.\" The University of Miami School of Law Human Rights Clinic also found that deportees \"have been robbed, denied jobs and housing for which they were qualified, shunned in their neighborhoods, and physically attacked on account of their physical appearance and speech, denoting their status as deportees from the U.S.\" Last fall, he boarded a plane to Nicaragua, then crossed by foot into Mexico, hoping to gain asylum in the United States. Bernabe decided to stay in Mexico, where he legalized his status and has a factory job. He\u2019s not ready to return to the United States, worrying about the uncertain status of Haitians. Deportees are often the first suspects in local crimes, Kivland said. In one such case in August, neighborhood residents accused a deportee of involvement in a home burglary. He was \"shot and killed as a result without any due process,\" and no one was arrested for his shooting, she said. In Haitian communities, the announcement sparked fear, protests and lawsuits. The U.S. is preparing to deport thousands, even as it imposes a \u201cdo not travel\u201d advisory on Haiti, citing widespread kidnapping,\u00a0crime,\u00a0sexual assault, civil unrest and\u00a0limited health care. \u201cThey had no right to hold those people,\u201d Karshan said, stressing that detaining deportees without charge is\u00a0illegal under Haitian\u00a0and international human rights law. With his American accent and tattoos on his face and arms, Rosier said he is easily identifiable as a deportee. He rarely goes out. Most days, he has one meal, usually rice and beans. Last month, a friend sent him $25, so he went to a park and bought a dish of plantains and ground beef. Deportees said they were still haunted by their time in prison, where they saw dozens die of starvation and cholera. Cells were so overcrowded they slept sitting or standing, and rats crawled on them as they slept. On Feb. 4, the first group of Haitian migrants deported since Trump\u2019s return to the White House \u2015 21 men in total \u2015 were brought to police holding cells and held for eight days without charge. They landed in the northern city of Cap-Hai\u0308tien; U.S. flights to the Port-au-Prince were suspended in November after three civilian planes, operated by Spirit, JetBlue and American Airlines, were hit with gunfire. \"Not being able to get a house, a job, a car, these are things that will leave the deportee at greater risk of engaging in other activities that would put the deportee at risk, whether they are stealing from others or joining the 'baz,' or gangs in Haiti,\" Kivland said. The park was full of homeless families who had fled other parts of Haiti, he said. Ongoing gang violence has displaced more than a million people, nearly a tenth of the population, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Haiti said in February. Other deportees have also struggled. Some deportees have gotten involved with gangs, including offenders who \"turn back to crime\" and people who have no opportunities and no local support, he said. But most are just trying to rebuild their lives, he said. All have been scapegoated, he added. In an interview last year, another deportee, Bergson Morin, 35, of Philadelphia,\u00a0Penn., said he had fled to the Dominican Republic and hoped to reach Mexico. If not for his sister and her husband in Haiti, he said, \"I absolutely would not have made it out alive,\" and \"would not have been able to eat.\" In Haiti, one's status as a deportee brings an added level of risk. Deportees, especially those deported for criminal matters, have long been viewed by authorities and citizens as outsiders and are blamed for bringing crime and violence to Haiti. President Donald Trump has signed a series of executive orders laying groundwork for mass deportations, including Haitians American communities. In February, administration officials announced they will end \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d for 521,000 Haitians starting in August. The status, known as TPS, gives temporary permission for migrants to live and work in the U.S. because their native country is deemed unsafe for return. The United States first granted TPS to Haitians after a massive earthquake in 2010 and extended it multiple times. A new wave of migrants arrived in recent years, as Haiti plunged into political turmoil and violence. \"\"They just deport you and leave you there,\" he said. \"They don\u2019t care what happens to you.\" \u201cThey are coming back they are not prepared for the conditions or situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. People\u2019s lives are in danger here. They don\u2019t have the necessities they need to survive. There is no government here. There is no help.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still in prison; I\u2019m in Haiti,\u201d said Rosier, 37, who grew up in Florida. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. I stay inside the house. I don\u2019t like to move around. Anything is possible. Everything is a threat. If I leave, people will be watching me, thinking I\u2019m going to do something. If people don't know me \u2015 I'm new in town \u2015 they will assume I'm in some type of gang.\" A legal U.S. resident, Julney was deported following drug and robbery convictions and jail terms \u2014 among more than 27,000 Haitians that the former Biden Administration deported to the Caribbean nation. He made mistakes, he said, but he has paid for them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even make it out of the airport,\u201d said Saguens Bernabe, 36, who lived in Georgia and Ohio and was deported in 2022. \u201cThey said, \u2018Look at the deportees. They came to ruin the country. They\u2019re the reason why all these gangs are terrorizing the population. They said other crazy stuff about us taking their women and daughters.\u201d Human rights groups and lawmakers intervened to end their detention, but it has continued \u201con and off\u201d in a system rife with corruption, Karshan said. He made mistakes, he said, but feels like is paying every day. Like other deportees, he served a criminal sentence, then was held in immigration detention, and then imprisoned in Haiti before being released into a country both unsafe and unwelcoming. He was stranded in a country where political upheaval and gang violence have become so dire that its capital is now ranked as the most dangerous city in the world. After President Jovenel Moi\u0308se\u2019s assassination in 2021, gangs increased control across Haiti and now reportedly have overtaken 85% of the capital. Violence and kidnappings are at record levels. More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence last year, the UN reported. Half the population faces acute hunger. Immigrant advocacy groups have sued over the cancelation of TPS. They argue that Trump's order is discriminatory, citing \u201cdehumanizing and disparaging statements\u201d he has made against Haitian migrants. Trump has maintained that the TPS program, which the Biden Administration expanded, had been \u201cexploited and abused\u201d and that it unfairly benefited people who entered the U.S. illegally. Their imprisonment sparked fears that Haiti was reviving a banned practice. \u201cYou have the Conventions Against Torture act, and this is exactly what you are sending people to,\u201d Bernabe said. \u201cI\u2019ve written to a judge a detailed letter or what would happen to me if I got deported. Everything in that letter happened to a tee and then some.\u201d \"As a deportee \u2015 it doesn't matter the case or anything like that \u2015 they just see everybody as the worst animal,\" he said. \"It's the worst thing you can think of when it comes to Haiti.\" Political turmoil is not new in Haiti, nor is discrimination against deportees. Haitian officials and the press have long blamed them for crime and gang violence, advocates said. \u201cThey tried to burn my house one time,\u201d said Patrick Julney, 41, a deportee from New Jersey who stayed with family after his release from Haiti's National Penitentiary in 2022. \u201cI diffused the situation because I know people around here. Wherever you go, it\u2019s \u2018We\u2019re watching you, we\u2019re going to kill you, this ain\u2019t America, it\u2019s Haiti\u2019 \u2026 They hate us. I\u2019m like, I just came here. I don\u2019t even know nobody.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a changed man,\u201d said Julney. \u201cI\u2019m older, I did my time, and I paid my dues to the community. Why I got to come to Haiti and go through this?\u201d William O'Neill, expert on Haiti for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said at a press conference Tuesday that the United States and other nations should halt deportations to Haiti. \"You cannot guarantee a dignified safe return which is required under international law to deport people,\u201d O'Neill said. Immediately upon arrival in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital where the United States deported him in 2022, Haitian authorities illegally imprisoned him without charge. He had not lived in Haiti since age 4. Julney had lived in the U.S. since age 2. He did not know his mother, and his father, who wrote political music, was killed in Haiti when he was a boy. Homeless at 12, an aunt in New Jersey took him in. As violence in Haiti escalates, advocates worry that a growing number of deportees will now be in the same predicament: targeted by a U.S. president ran on a campaign to deport dangerous immigrants, then sent to a country where many view them the same way, often with devastating results. Julney is laying low in the Dominican Republic, where Haitians have also been rounded up for mass deportation. He can\u2019t legally work, he said, but he is relieved to have escaped the violence that plagued Haiti. His wife visited in February, which he called \u201ca blessing.\u201d His dream is to one day return to New Jersey to be with her and his three stepchildren. \"They are often the most dreaded sector of Haitian society,\" she said. \"Now it's gangs. They see all criminal deportees as being part of gangs, and I see that very few are.\" The Haitian government's communications office and its embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to requests for comment. They included 12 men convicted of crimes in the U.S. and nine who had no criminal record. Authorities told the Haitian Times that they were investigating possible gang affiliations among some of the men, and that a police delegation that was supposed to screen the men on Feb. 6 did not show up. Karshan believes police held them under false pretenses to extort payment. Targeted by police, deportees said they had been imprisoned without charge, surveilled and harassed. Armed watch groups don\u2019t want them in their neighborhoods. Gangs have tried to kidnap them for ransom or draft them into their ranks. Hostilities have escalated to extortion, violence and even lynching, said advocates and researchers who work with deportees in Haiti. NorthJersey.com and The Record spoke with four men who had been deported to Haiti under the Biden Administration after serving their jail time for criminal offenses, including drug possession, assault and burglary. Unable to get work, they rely on help from friends and family in the U.S., but they often go hungry. Some have fled Haiti for safety in other countries. He was not deported then. The United States halted deportations in 2010 after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti. But 21 years after the earthquake, police pulled him over and found a controlled substance in his vehicle. It was Xanax, he said, and he didn't have a prescription. He was arrested and deported. Authorities demanded that deportees pay thousands for supposed legal fees, to appear before a judge or for paperwork for their release \u2015 requests that advocates decried as extortion. Their families in the United States worked extra shifts, depleted retirement savings and borrowed to help them. Peterson, too, dreams of returning to the United States and helping to raise his 12-year-old son. His father was not in his life, he said. His mother died when he was 12. He did not realize he was not a citizen until he was arrested for assault when he was 18. While on probation, he was arrested for robbery, court records show. Fearing for their safety, deportees said they stayed out of the public eye. Bernabe and others deportees said they also were targeted for speaking to media and protesting over their illegal imprisonment. Eventually, he moved to Haiti\u2019s countryside, but gangs had spread there too.", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/business/2025/03/12/canada-tariffs-nj-european-union/82310247007/": "The EU announced Wednesday it would impose counter tariffs on $28 billion of U.S. goods to retaliate for 25% tariffs that President Donald Trump has imposed on steel and aluminum from Europe, Canada and elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Canadian officials meanwhile slapped over $20 billion of tariffs on U.S exports. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump threatened 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum coming into the U.S from Canada, but backed off hours later.

Morgan's chief economist Bruce Kasman said he saw a 40% chance of a U.S. recession this year, which would rise to 50% if Trump follows through on threats to impose reciprocal tariffs from April. He also warned of lasting damage to the United States as an investment destination if the administration undermines trust in governance. LONDON (Reuters) - Makers of goods from sportswear to luxury cars and chemicals painted a gloomy picture on Wednesday of consumer and industrial health, adding to concerns about the damage from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade wars and hitting share prices again. \"The big risk is that companies stop spending and equally the consumer also stalls purchases,\" said Justin Onuekwusi, chief investment officer at investment firm St. James's Place. Trump's plans for tariffs - and their back-and-forth implementation since he took office in January - have upended industries from cars to energy and unnerved businesses and investors. Worries that rising costs will reignite inflation, and that souring consumer sentiment could herald a U.S. recession, have caused stock markets to plunge. For premium support please call: Germany's Porsche said on Wednesday it was assessing how it could pass on to consumers the cost of possible tariffs - expected to be 25% for U.S. imports from Europe - without pressuring its margins.

The tariffs are already driving prices for aluminium users in the United States to record highs. 'CONFUSING, INSCRUTABLE' The constant flip-flopping over tariffs is paralysing industries from healthcare and retailing to agriculture, mining, energy, he said. Automakers, for example, are unable to plan while there is a threat of 25% tariffs on components made in Canada or Mexico. Even without higher tariffs, lower sales, high costs and trade concerns would hurt 2025 earnings, the luxury carmaker warned. Its shares were down 4.5%. Asked about a recession resulting from his trade policies, Trump said on Tuesday: \"I don't see it at all.\" On Monday, he had declined to rule one out. CEO Oscar Garcia Maceiras said he was \"optimistic\" about the U.S. market despite the tit-for-tat trade measures, and that Inditex company was well positioned to adapt as needed. Spain's Inditex reported a slower start to its first-quarter starting February 1, raising questions about weakening consumer demand, particularly in the United States, its second-biggest market. Increased tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminium imports took effect on Wednesday, as Trump steps up his campaign to reorder global trade in favour of the United States. Europe swiftly retaliated.

The energy sector, which includes oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals, has historically accounted for about 80% of Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s export revenues. While these payments significantly contribute to government revenue, a portion is paid in foreign currency. These efforts aimed to bolster the country\u2019s energy production while ensuring that Trinidad and Tobago remained competitive in the global market. The pandemic led to global shutdowns, forcing businesses, schools, and public services to close.

In late 2023, T&T renegotiated contracts related to its flagship project, Atlantic LNG, leading to increased government revenue from liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. It explained that energy companies contribute to T&T\u2019s forex availability because T&T has an integrated gas value chain with upstream companies exploring for and producing oil and gas, midstream companies processing, transporting and marketing gas, and downstream companies using gas as a fuel and feedstock for petrochemical production. Five years after the Covid-19 outbreak, businesses in Trinidad and Tobago are still grappling with its lasting effects. The government launched Vision 2030 in 2016 as part of its long-term plan to transition towards a more diversified economy. It emphasised the development of sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, and information technology to reduce dependence on oil and gas revenues. The vision aimed to create sustainable economic growth, generate new employment opportunities, and improve the country\u2019s overall economic resilience in the face of global energy market fluctuations.

In the meantime, the TTEITI reported that bpTT had a substantial spike in payments in 2015 and 2022, contributing to a total surpassing US$2.5 billion that year, while subsequent years saw a decline in its contribution. \u201cMidstream and downstream companies currently do not remit their taxes in USD. In the budget, the Minister of Finance signalled an intent to amend existing legislation to mandate these companies to pay their tax obligations in US dollars. Based on data from the Gas Master Plan, between 2009-2014, these midstream and downstream companies contributed US$31.2 billion in corporation taxes. By ensuring these companies pay in US dollars, the government will be adding to the forex pool,\u201d the TTEITI stated. The new terms allowed LNG cargoes to be sold at 15% to 55% above the Henry Hub benchmark, ensuring greater returns compared to previous agreements. This revamp allowed T&T to maximise returns from its natural gas resources at a time when global LNG demand remains strong. \u201cShell displays sharp increases in 2019 and 2022, significantly impacting the total for that year, which again exceeds US$1.5 billion.

BHP/Woodside\u2019s payments range from US$4.2 million to US$154 million over the period,\u201d the report stated. \u201cOver the eight-year period reviewed, 2022 and in some cases 2015, coincided with the highest USD payments received for the companies. This is attributed to higher commodity prices in 2022 despite lower production levels, compared to 2015, which saw increased production but lower prices,\u201d it highlighted. \u201cThe Atlantic Train 1 plant has not been operational since 2020. The Atlantic shareholders, bp, Shell and the National Gas Company of Trinidad & Tobago (NGC), agreed to decouple the Train from the rest of the Atlantic facility with a view to decommissioning it.

Initiatives were also introduced to enhance production efficiency and attract foreign investment in the energy sector. Instagram Between 2015 and 2017, the global decline in oil prices led to reduced revenues from the energy sector.

Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.

She previously worked at Bloomberg News and has written for national news outlets including USA Today and Consumer Reports. ByAimee Picchi Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say. Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.

(NASDAQ:REGN) is a pharmaceutical company that develops, discovers, and commercializes therapies for several diseases, including cancer, eye disorders, and allergic conditions. The company is advancing around 40 of its programs. It has relied on two primary products to drive top-line growth in the past years: Dupixent and Eylea. Dupixent is an eczema treatment whose rights Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) shares with Sanofi. Eylea, which Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) comarkets with Bayer, treats wet age-related macular generation. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here). Although the potential reasons for this trend vary, experts believe this scenario is here to stay. While it is anticipated to affect the US pharmaceutical sector, how these repercussions might materialize is unclear. Some experts believe it could ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at a low price; others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation: Leon Cooperman Soros Fund Management Jim Simons Talking about the tariffs, she said that their materialization poses a big open question for the pharmaceutical sector as some companies assemble their products in the US after manufacturing them abroad. Manufacturing costs are thus pretty low for these companies, which is a significant point to consider when determining the impact of tariffs. She believed that absorbing the additional cost of the tariffs would be very manageable for these companies. The market has reached the tail-end of the earnings season, and the situation hasn\u2019t come up much on earnings calls over this quarter.\u201d Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 Point72 Asset Management Despite struggles in the healthcare sector, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) has outperformed the broader market and its biotech peers since 2022. It holds a dominant position in the cystic fibrosis market and is expanding its offerings beyond it. The company recently attained approval for Alyftrek to treat CF, further consolidating its presence in the market. It has low market competition and patents locked up into the 2030s, which is why investors are bullish on the stock. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d John Paulson $4,198,712,000 The US pharmaceutical sector is experiencing a distinct trend never seen before with large American pharma companies continually looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. Experts are attributing several reasons to this trend. Some believe that Chinese pharmaceutical companies are attracting attention because of their advanced development capabilities that are producing effective molecules in substantial quantities. These Chinese companies are also in a position to assign a lower price to these medicines compared to the US, and are capable of initiating their testing on human subjects quicker. According to CNBC, buyers have devised a business model allowing them to import medicines through licensing deals. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.

To continue this momentum, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) and Sanofi are seeking a label expansion for the drug to treat a rare skin disease called bullous pemphigoid. If approved, Dupixent would become the first targeted drug in this narrow indication in the US. $6,160,740,000 Appaloosa Management LP Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a global biotechnology company that develops medicines for rare serious diseases. Its four approved medicines treat cystic fibrosis (CF), and one approved therapy treats severe sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT). The company\u2019s product pipeline includes clinical-stage programs for various disorders, including TDT, SCD, CF, acute and neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, myotonic dystrophy type 1, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Greenlight Capital Omega Advisors Another reason behind this bullish sentiment is the recent regulatory approval Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) attained for Journavx (formerly known as suzetrigine) to treat acute pain. The drug does not have the addiction risks associated with opioid painkillers and delivers excellent pain relief, ranking this oral non-opioid pain signal inhibitor among the first new class of pain medicine in over 20 years. Paul Tudor Jones \u201cOn February 20, Emily Field, Head of European Pharma Research at Barclays, appeared on CNBC to discuss the dynamics of the pharmaceutical sector, the impact of US tariffs, and the performance of obesity drugs. She believed the industry may not underperform this year, at least in the first half. However, there are still several questions surrounding the performance of obesity drugs, as major players in the domain have exhibited contrasting previous year performance. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) also has strong fundamentals. It delivered $2.91 billion in revenue in fiscal Q4 2024, representing 16% growth versus Q4 2023. For the full year 2024, revenue reached a record of just over $11 billion, reflecting a 12% growth versus 2023 and exceeding the company\u2019s full-year product revenue guidance.

Warren Buffett While the company\u2019s products are under pressure due to competition for its Eylea franchise, analysts believe Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:REGN) stock could grow by 50% from its current levels in the next year. This optimism is because, despite pressures, the company grew its total revenue by 10% year-over-year to $3.8 billion in fiscal Q4 2024. The positive performance was primarily due to Dupixent, which recorded a 15% year-over-year growth in its worldwide net sales to $3.7 billion in fiscal Q4 2024.

February\u2019s core CPI came in better than expected as well, rising 0.2% for the month (from 0.4% in January) and slowing to 3.1% annually from 3.2%. In February, shelter inflation slowed to an annual rate of 4.2%, its lowest since December 2021. Shelter, which accounts for more than one-third of the overall CPI, has been the biggest impediment to inflation\u2019s descent. Your account has been registered, and you are now logged in. February\u2019s inflation numbers came in better than expected thanks in part to two big \u2014 and very welcome \u2014 reasons: Grocery prices were flat for the month and gas prices fell. The Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes across commonly purchased goods and services, was 2.8% for the 12 months ended in February, a cooldown from the 3% annual rate notched in January, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2%, versus 0.5% in January. Reining in decades-high inflation was expected to be a slow and bumpy process. And readings have been a little choppy in recent months, prompting the central bank to take a more cautious approach to rate cuts in 2025. No promotional rates found. Thank you. Still, the softer inflation reading means that Americans wages are going even farther. Despite some of the recent undulations, economists \u2014 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell \u2014 have noted that the underlying data continues to show that the pace of price hikes is slowing. Core CPI is at its lowest annual rate in nearly four years. Updated: March 12, 2025 @ 11:40 am Food prices are also under pressure, he added. Thank you .

However, McBride, other analysts and economists on Wednesday expressed caution that the friendly February print may very well be the calm before the storm. \u201cMy colleague Sarah House has a good phrase on this: \u2018Inflation is a process,\u2019\u201d Cervi said. \u201cA lot of it is reflecting past business decisions and how that\u2019s being reflected in prices.\u201d Economists were expecting inflation to slow for the month amid falling gas prices and continued disinflation in housing-related costs. FactSet consensus estimates called for prices to rise 0.3% from January and 2.9% annually. Wages have risen faster than inflation for 22 months now (they\u2019re running 1.2% faster as of February). However, they remain below the heights reached during the pandemic recovery. \u201cGood news on the inflation fronts in February, but a cloud cover is on the horizon,\u201d Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist at SS Economics, wrote Wednesday. \u201cLooking ahead, the inflation landscape has become increasingly uncertain as various economic factors begin to take effect.

Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group President Trump has shocked economists as he continues to double down on tariffs on Canada and Mexico; on Tuesday he said he would\u00a0double the planned tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 percent for Canada, escalating the trade war as a response to the price increases Ontario put on electricity sold to the US.

It'll just take a moment. A day after Hatzius issued his research note, President Trump announced that an additional 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum will go into effect on Wednesday. The policy change likely will result in higher prices for U.S. manufacturers that rely on Canadian imports. Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius cut his 2025 U.S. GDP growth forecast to 1.7%, pointing to the impact of tariffs on the economy and consumers. At the start of this year, he was predicting 2.4% growth. You are just one step away from creating your watchlist! Tariffs may also spur inflation. Hatzius anticipates that the core Personal Consumption Expenditure price index (core PCE) may reaccelerate to 3% later this year, up nearly half a percentage point from his prior forecast. \u201cIn theory, a tariff hike raises the price level permanently but only raises the inflation rate temporarily. In practice, this hinges on the assumption that inflation expectations remain well-anchored, which looks a bit more tenuous following the pickup in the UMich and Conference Board inflation expectations measures,\" he writes, referring to the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index, which shows sentiment souring. Although Trump campaigned on implementing far-reaching tariffs, the president\u2019s policy announcements seem to have caught investors off guard and sent markets tumbling. So far this year, the S&P 500 is down 5.1%, and the Nasdaq has fallen 9.7%. The selloff wiped out gains stocks made after Election Day when investors focused on aspects of the president\u2019s agenda deemed more pro-growth, such as deregulation and tax cuts. Consumer discretionary and bank stocks, which are seen as economically sensitive, have been among the hardest hit. Your session has expired, please login again. In a March 10 research note, Hatzius said \u201ctrade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse and the administration is managing expectations toward tariff-induced near-term economic weakness.\" He now expects the average U.S. tariff rate to rise by 10 percentage points this year, twice his previous forecast and about five times the increase seen in the first administration of President Donald Trump. The outlook for the U.S. economy this year isn\u2019t so rosy anymore. Those tariffs join a burgeoning list of tariff increases that Trump has unveiled on roughly $1.4 trillion worth of goods coming from Canada, Mexico, and China. Those three countries are the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partners. The president has temporarily paused some of the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods until April. Hatzius notes that tariffs can dampen economic growth because they raise consumer prices and thereby cut real income. Tariffs also tend to tighten financial conditions, and trade policy uncertainty leads firms to delay investment, he writes. Hatzius estimates that tariffs will subtract 0.8 of a percentage point from GDP growth over the next year. Potential tax cuts and regulatory easing, which are seen as pro-growth, will only offset 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points of this drag, he says. You are now subscribed to our newsletters.

President Trump imposed 10 per cent tariffs on all imports from China in February and raised the tariff subsequently to 20 per cent. China, she noted, has reduced its protectionist policies especially in the last few months. She added that the global economy is changing and India has an enormous task of industrializing the economy. \"Giving too much protection and access to domestic market without sufficient competition will be detrimental to trade and in the long run detrimental to our growth.\u201d \u201cWe will have to bring in all measures to raise the competitiveness of our markets. Many sectors in our economy have enjoyed protection for some time. When you have seen protectionist measures in other markets - it\u2019s through export subsidies, targeted towards exports. Most of the other markets have protected trade by way of the state bearing the cost of either improvement in quality of the product, which means export or basic subsidies.\u00a0This has led to production of world class products.

The import duties on goods from Canada, China and Mexico are aimed at forcing more cooperation from those countries on stopping illegal immigration and drug smuggling into the U.S., the White House said. The U.S. at midnight began imposing 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from all trading partners without exception, the White House said. Trump paused until April 2 across-the-board tariffs that had been set for March 4 on goods from Canada and Mexico that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. However, he said he is considering imposing reciprocal tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy products soon. The European Union and Canada on Wednesday placed new trade duties on about $49 billion worth of U.S. goods in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s metals tariffs. Ontario, Canada, on Tuesday dropped a 25% surcharge it had planned to place on electricity sold to the U.S., in response to an announcement by Trump that he would impose a 50% rather than 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, The Associated Press reported. NBC News later reported that Trump appeared to back away from imposing the 50% tariff. \u201cAs of this morning the United States is applying a 25% tariff on imports of steel and aluminium. We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up. In Europe and in the United States. The Commission must act to protect consumers and business,\u201d von der Leyen said in a news release. The EU said it will allow the suspension of existing 2018 and 2020 countermeasures against the U.S. to lapse on\u00a0 April 1. Those tariffs target a range of U.S. products that respond to the economic harm done on $8.7 billion of European steel and aluminium exports, the European Commission said. The EU has responded to Trump\u2019s metals duties with countertariffs on $28 billion in U.S. goods. In addition to steel and aluminum retaliatory tariffs announced by Canada and the EU,\u00a0 both countries are implementing duties that could affect U.S. exports such as beef, motorcycles and whiskey. Canada on Wednesday announced tariffs on $21 billion worth of U.S. goods in response to Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum duties. Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods in February and doubled the rate to 20% on Tuesday. China has responded with up to 15% duties on U.S. foods such as beef, chicken and pork that began Monday. In response to new U.S. tariffs affecting more than $19.6 billion of EU exports, the EU is moving forward with a package of new countermeasures on U.S. exports that will come into force by mid-April. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, defended the EU\u2019s actions. The European Commission is the primary executive arm of the European Union. \u201cFor years, the European Union has opposed the United States\u2019 efforts to reindustrialize. The EU has rejected attempts under successive U.S. administrations to cooperate effectively on dealing with global excess capacity on steel, aluminum, and other sectors, employing measures that are too little and too late,\u201d U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a news release. \u201cIf the EU acted as quickly to address global excess capacity as it does to punish the United States, we likely would be in a different situation today. The EU\u2019s punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States \u2013 and indeed international security \u2013 and is yet another indicator that the EU\u2019s trade and economic policies are out of step with reality.\u201d", "https://www.aol.co.uk/news/most-popular-stocks-investors-february-060031769.html": "However, Nvidia (NVDA) guided to gross profit margins of 70.6% to 71% in the first quarter, which would be down on the 73% it reported in the fourth quarter.

There is growing concern that a tariff trade war could stoke already stubborn inflation and be a further drag on economic growth.

Server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) appeared on Robinhood (HOOD) and AJ Bell's (AJB.L) popular stock lists last month. Even before Trump and Zelensky's clash at the White House, comments from officials at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, added to expectations of higher defence spending in Europe.

But on President Donald Trump's first day in office, he issued an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to\u00a0ensure that \"aliens\" comply with their duty to register and treat violations \"as a civil and criminal enforcement priority\" as part of the new administration's sweeping crackdown on immigration. (This story was updated with new information.) \u201cThis policy is associated with some of the most shameful stains on our country\u2019s history, including the reactionary and xenophobic internment of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent in concentration camps across the United States during WWII, as well as racist and xenophobic profiling in the wake of September 11th,\u201d Jayapal said in a release. \u201cNow, the Trump administration is aiming to use this policy as a tool to force immigrants to register and subject themselves to a mass deportation scheme.\u201d The USCIS will be creating a process for visitors to register and suggests that anyone who will need to register create a\u00a0USCIS online account to be ready for it. You can find details on how to do that here. According to the USCIS, visitors who are already registered include: Traditionally, Canadians who flew into the country had to register, but anyone driving over the northern border into the U.S. was not required to as Canada has had a friendly status with the United States. U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a ranking member of the Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee, announced Wednesday plans to introduce the No Round Up Act to repeal the immigration law that allows this move. Everyone else will need to complete Form G-325R, Biographic Information (Registration). The new requirements take effect on Friday, April 11, 2025, 30 days after the new requirements were published in the Federal Register. Getting lumped in with foreign nationals who commit \"vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans,\" as the EO states, may not sit well with our Northern neighbors who are already upset about the constant threats of tariffs and Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state. Many Canadians have boycotted U.S. products and announced plans to vacation somewhere else. Warm and sunny Florida is a choice destination for snowbirds coming down from the Great White North. Last year, nearly 3.3 million Canadians came to the Sunshine State, according to data from VisitFlorida.org, making up 27% of our total international visitors. Visitors 18 and over must keep proof of their registration with them at all times, the USCIS said. The exceptions: American Indians born in Canada who entered the United States under section 289 of the INA, and members of the Texas Band of Kickapoo Indians who entered the United States under the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act are not required to register. The new requirements will take effect on Friday, April 11, according to the DHS document published in the Federal Register Wednesday. There is no fee to register, although the DHS did float the idea of charging $30 per registrant and welcomed comment on the option. Failure or refusal to register or be fingerprinted, or failure to keep proof of registration on their person at all times, is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to six months, or both.", "https://www.aol.com/finance/job-openings-rose-january-remained-155554483.html": "In data released since, consumers appear to have soured more on the outlook for the labor market. In February, The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence index saw its largest month-over-month drop in four years, partially driven by a souring mood in the labor market. Nearly 26% of respondents said they anticipate fewer jobs to be available in the next 12 months, up from 21% the month prior. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.39 million hires were made during the month, up slightly from the 5.37 million made during December. The hiring rate held flat at 3.4%. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, rose to 2.1%, up from the 1.9% seen the two months prior. The JOLTS report is a lagging dataset. Tuesday's release reflects where the labor market stood at the end of January before several of President Trump's key policies \u2014 including tariffs and government job cuts \u2014 went into effect. AOL New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed 7.74 million jobs open at the end of January, an increase from the 7.51 million seen in December.

Other data released by ADP showed hiring in the private sector slowed in February as Trump's policies came into focus. Data from ADP revealed the private sector added 77,000 jobs in February, significantly lower than the 186,000 jobs added in January.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.6 million openings in January. \"We expect to see more of an impact of that freeze along with more recent layoffs of federal workers in the February JOLTS report,\" Vanden Houten wrote. Labor market data released Tuesday was largely in line with Wall Street's expectations, reflecting a gradually cooling labor market.

This humanitarian crisis is compounded by the fact that over 400,000 Palestinians [\u2026] Name * Donald Trump\u2019s administration, unlike that of his predecessor, has a lot of political capital amongst Israelis, especially the far-right of the political spectrum there and the President\u2019s entire cabinet is staffed with hardline right wing Zionists. Yet, the most pro-Israeli administration in US history is now negotiating with Hamas, so what is happening here? Meanwhile, if we take a look at Israel\u2019s internal political scene, Netanyahu is slowly adopting a more dictatorial rule. The newly instated Israeli military\u2019s chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, who himself has maintained a longtime relationship with the PM, is now purging voices critical of the Israeli Premier from within the armed forces, such as its former spokesperson Daniel Hagari. An important point to note is that Zionist power does not only lie in Israel, but also in the United States, where there are also many concerned Zionists who seek to save the Israeli regime from its current predicament. If the above-mentioned theory is true, the issues surrounding Israel\u2019s fate are not only tied to Gaza but the wider region as a whole. Which may explain why the US has worked together with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Syria to merge with the new administration in Damascus headed by Ahmed al-Shara\u2019a. Even though Netanyahu had from the get-go pledged to return to the war after phase one of the three-phase deal, under immense pressure from his far-right coalition allies, the situation is yet to return to a full-scale conflict. Additionally, Netanyahu may appear to be some kind of hardline ideologue, but his history suggests instead he is more of a political survivor concerned with self preservation. If the US is indeed trying to find a solution independent of the Netanyahu-run government, essentially forcing a solution upon it, it would make sense of all the contradictory statements and moves made by the Trump administration. On the one hand, the US cannot override Netanyahu, so it must make moves to support him publicly, but if it is truly working to save Israel from its current path, it will have to force its hand while making it seem as if everything was actually Netanyahu\u2019s idea. The Trump administration\u2019s pursuit of direct negotiations with Hamas did not occur by accident. This historic move signals that the US does not trust Israel to negotiate a settlement alone. We see these critical voices in disagreement with Netanyahu from every sector, including the Mossad, Shin Bet, private corporations, the army and political opposition. Even former Israeli Prime Ministers such as Ehud Olmert have warned of Israel\u2019s impending collapse if it continues on its current unhinged trajectory. Comment \u2013 Robert Inlakesh is a journalist, writer, and documentary filmmaker. He focuses on the Middle East, specializing in Palestine. He contributed this article to The Palestine Chronicle. US envoy Adam Boehler has publicly defended his private direct talks with Hamas officials, which did not include Israel, asserting that this strategy is designed to reach an agreement. While most analysts have invested their time in analysing what this means for the US-Israel relationship, focusing on looking at he-said-she said reporting, almost everyone has missed the elephant in the room. Also, the other major issues pertain to Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon. It is possible that the US may see a regional flare up as inevitable and it is likely that Donald Trump will decide to directly support an Israeli attack against Iran, but work to bring it to a stalemate after the fighting greatly intensifies. \u2018We\u2019re Not Agent of Israel\u2019 \u2013 Envoy Describes US-Hamas Talks as \u2018Very Helpful\u2019 While the Israelis are threatening Balkanization and chaos, which could lead to a direct confrontation inside Syria, the US quickly worked to contain the situation there. What we may be seeing, is Washington\u2019s attempt to save Israel from itself. At least, this is the only way to make sense of the US holding direct negotiations with Hamas for the first time ever. Even if the situation returns to full-scale conflict, it is still possible that a deal will be carved out in order to bring the war to a complete close. This could even be aided by a regional trade off between Israel and Iran. It appears as if the United States has taken over in leading the course of the Gaza Ceasefire negotiations, which are aimed at freeing the remaining Israeli captives held in Gaza, reconstruction, post-war governance, and ending the war. Also, the threats issued by Trump have translated to an extensive Egyptian Proposal for a post-war Gaza that has been ratified by Arab Leaders. This step may not solve the issue, but is moving the process forward. By Ramzy Baroud \u00a0 The fact that Israeli ministers and other leading politicians quickly began advancing plans for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza immediately after October 7, indicates that Zionism has never abandoned those early [\u2026] Email * Copyright \u00a9 1999-2025 PalestineChronicle.com. All rights reserved | Powered By Media Seniors Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s solution for the survival of the Israeli State is explicit and falls in line with the demands of his right-wing coalition\u2019s expansionist endeavors; he seeks \u201ctotal victory\u201d in a \u201cseven front war\u201d. Yet many actors within Israel\u2019s own so-called \u201cdeep-State\u201d, are not in agreement with this vision. How it does that and whether it will be successful is yet to be seen. However, if the US wants to save Israel from itself, it would make sense that American Zionists would be working alongside their contacts in Israel to ensure an outcome that prevents a chaotic total war that could easily lead to the Zionist project\u2019s collapse. The Shin Bet chief has had a well documented recent history of quarrels with Netanyahu. So, placing Dermer \u2013 a man with strong connections inside the US \u2013 as his negotiations lead, meant that the Israeli PM has been easily able to control the course of the negotiations, pushing the ceasefire to the brink of collapse. What lies behind Israel's attempts to prolong the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza? What are the Palestinian resistance's strategies at this stage? Gaza Ceasefire Talks Resume in Doha while Israel Faces Internal Rifts In order to make sense of this, we must first put aside the rhetoric and the pledges made by Trump, that appear implausible for him to follow through on, especially considering the threats made against Hamas to release all Israeli captives by specific deadlines, which ended up being bluffs. Website If the US Trump administration is going to prevent an outcome that could result in the loss of millions of lives, also heavily burdening the American military at a time when Washington is desperately trying to assert itself in the new multi-polar order, it must act to contain the inevitable clash. As of now, the regional war is still open but is in a state of stagnation. There is a tense feeling across the region, making everyone anxious. The recent declaration by Qatar, that it is demanding the Israeli nuclear program be placed under IAEA supervision indicates how serious the threat of total war is. Yet, the US, which will undoubtedly play a role, appears to be in no position to hedge its bet on a victory in a massive cataclysmic war that could end up leading in any direction, including the deployment of nuclear weapons. Has international law collapsed in Gaza? What does US complicity mean for Palestinians under Israeli siege? Is the UN powerless in the face of genocide? For example, the War Cabinet was dissolved, after top Israeli political figures like opposition leader, Benny Gantz, and former Israeli army chief of staff, Gadi Eisenkot, left it, stating that it had become paralysed due to infighting. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has been making a steady stream of outrageous comments that have pleased Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners, who believe that the American President\u2019s rhetoric could translate into a US-backed effort to ethnically cleanse Gaza. This has bought Netanyahu time and makes him appear as if he is receiving considerable backing from Washington. \u2018Assault\u2019 on Free Speech \u2013 US Lawmakers Demand Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s Release A recent New York Times made many claims about the \u2018mass rape\u2019 of Israeli women on October 7. But two leading Palestinian media organizations, The Palestine Chronicle and Friends of Palestine Network, conducted a joint investigation, the outcome of which resulted in the \u2018The Black Dress\u2019, a groundbreaking 18-minute documentary looking into allegations and the possible falsification of evidence. (The Palestine Chronicle) When it comes to Gaza, there is a reason that the war has not re-opened yet, despite Israel imposing a full siege on the territory, comparable to what they inflicted on the civilian population directly following October 7, 2023. This has triggered an immediate response from Yemen\u2019s Ansarallah, who moved to re-impose their blockade in the Red Sea. By Palestine Chronicle Staff \u00a0 According to Israeli media, the names of three captives were included in the exchange agreement of July 2, which was rejected by Netanyahu. The Israeli army announced on Sunday that [\u2026] The Gaza ceasefire, implemented on January 19, was almost word-for-word the same exact proposal that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected nearly a year prior.

BNP's strategists raised their average 2025 forecast average by 8%, with prices expected to push above $3,100 per ounce during the second quarter of 2025, noting tariff fears have \"dramatically\" tightened the physical gold market. Wall Street has attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared. \"Physical tightness due to the surge in demand for moving gold into the US ahead of tariffs, a pick-up in central bank buying and an acceleration in physically-backed ETF gold demand have been key YTD gold price supportive factors, and we expect this to continue through 2025,\" Wilson wrote. In a note to clients on Wednesday, BNP senior commodity strategist David Wilson said the firm expects gold prices to breach $3,000 per ounce for the first time and ultimately reach $3,100 in the coming months. Uncertainty about the global economy and Trump's tariff plans have triggered a sell-off in the US stock market. \"The Trump administration issuing a slew of tariff threats and the realigning of international relationships have added a new layer of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, providing a significant boost to gold,\" Wilson wrote in a note on Wednesday.

There may be other signs of economic instability. U.S.-based employers announced plans in February to cut 172,017\u00a0jobs, the \"highest total for the month since 2009,\" according to global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Goldman Sachs has bumped the chances of a slump from 15% to a still-modest 20%, but only because it still reckons the White House will pull back \u201cif the downside risks begin to look more serious.\" JPMorgan Chase figures there\u2019s a 40% chance of a downturn. It isn\u2019t \u2013 yet. That's mostly because American consumers are still in good financial shape, and the nation\u2019s businesses generally remain\u00a0optimistic\u00a0despite growing uncertainty about the trade conflicts and federal cuts, forecasters say. The gambit would sharply raise consumer prices and sap Americans' purchasing power while ratcheting up business uncertainty, experts say, curtailing investment and hiring. Speaking to NPR's \"Morning Edition\" program on March 11, Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said Americans should focus on two pieces of data: employment growth and household spending. \"So I would say if the job market turns negative and we're laying off private and public sector workers, that's the key No. 1 criterion,\" Gapen said in the interview. \"After that, I'd say it's more about household spending. Personal consumption.\" Washington state exported $57.8 billion worth of goods to the world in 2024, making it the ninth-largest state exporter\u00a0that year, according to the\u00a0Office of the United States Trade Representative, or USTR. The state's largest market was China, where it exported $12 billion worth of goods, followed by Canada ($7.9 billion), Japan ($5 billion), Mexico ($4.3 billion),\u00a0and South Korea ($3 billion). Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson previously said that retaliatory tariffs from Canada could impact \"at least $296 million in Washington agricultural exports.\" He added that Trump's tariffs would also raise living costs for Washington families and make the state's exports less competitive on the world stage. It wasn't all rosy, however. In December 2024, pending home sales in Washington were down 5.1% year-over-year, according to the OFM. Washington's economic outlook was largely positive, according to OFM's report, which was released in February. The monthly count of initial claims for unemployment insurance decreased by 1,900 in January 2025. In housing, 40,400 building permits were issued in December 2024, up by 4,500 from the previous year. The OFM also reported that the net percentage of lenders willing to make consumer loans was up 5.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2025. Consumer spending declined 2% in January. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics traced some of the drop to severe winter weather but noted early retail sales indicators in February point to a further retreat. USA TODAY contributed to this report. Some analysts say it\u2019s likely the nation will topple into a downturn if Trump moves ahead with all of the\u00a0tariffs\u00a0he has threatened on a broad range of imported goods. The unemployment rate in Washington state was 4.5% in December 2024, according to the latest data reported by the state's Office of Financial Management. This represents a 0.3% year-over-year increase. Washington's nonfarm jobs rose by 40,000 monthly, a 1.1% increase from the previous year. \"As of March 5, 952 federal employees have filed unemployment claims with Washington\u2019s Employment Security Department this year \u2013 about double the number of claims from the same time period last year, which saw 472 claims,\" the public media outlet reported, noting that most of the claims were filed after Trump took office. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index fell 2.7% Monday, compounding last week\u2019s losses, and it\u2019s down 8.7% from its record high in mid-February. That\u2019s a big worry because the effects of wealth gains or losses on consumer spending are four times as large now as during the previous two economic cycles, economist Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics said. With the\u00a0stock market tumbling, consumer confidence skidding, and U.S. companies ramping up layoffs, it may look like the nation is hurtling toward a\u00a0recession\u00a0amid\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s widening global trade war and federal job cuts. Trump has targeted China, Canada, and Mexico with tariffs and threats. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines recession as a \"significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\" There isn't a strict way to calculate whether the U.S. is in a recession, but economists keep a close eye on a few monthly economic indicators, such as income, employment, consumption, sales, and industrial production, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. But trouble spots are mounting. Economists are raising their inflation forecasts and downgrading their 2025 growth estimates. Here's what to know about the economic indicators of a recession and how Trump's policies might affect Washington state's economic outlook. The U.S. added 151,000 jobs in February, and the national unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, the Labor Department reported. Federal government employment declined, coinciding with the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. \u201cThe economy will likely suffer a downturn if the Trump administration follows through on the tariff increases it has announced and maintains those tariffs for more than a few months,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, posted on X on Monday.", "https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/fox-news-trump-tariffs-stocks-economic-pain-rcna195912": " So years of chronic pain, I guess. That\u2019s apparently what\u2019s required of all of us to make America great ... again.

Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., got on the pain train himself, during an interview with Larry Kudlow on Fox Business: I think it will slow the economy down a little bit. Then we have to count on cutting spending and cutting taxes, and cutting interest rates, to lift it in other places, so net-net ... we\u2019re going to make it through this. I still expect a recession, but this is not the Great Depression. We\u2019re not in 2000, we\u2019re not in 2009. We\u2019ll have some pain. But we have to, before we get to the game. During a conversation with Fox News host Harris Faulkner, Fox Business host Jackie DeAngelis had a similar message for viewers: More This is going to be hard. It might be a little painful, but the CEO of our country, President Donald Trump, is actually doing something that is really courageous, Harris.

By Ja'han Jones Other Fox shows, including \u201cThe Big Weekend Show\u201d and \u201cThe Big Money Show,\u201d have also featured hosts and guests predicting that some economic suffering is in store for Americans \u2014 but with assurances that it\u2019ll all be worth it in the end. In a way, they\u2019re doing a version of what Tucker Carlson did when he visited Moscow last year and said it was \u201cso much nicer\u201d than any American city. They\u2019re essentially encouraging their viewers to embrace a lower standard of living \u2014 and to view it as an act of service toward MAGA\u2019s grand vision for the country. Last fall, Elon Musk told people to expect \u201ctemporary hardship\u201d and a collapsed economy under Trump\u2019s economic policies, but the president and his allies have been more open recently in conceding that Americans will face such harm. This certainly wasn\u2019t the message coming from Fox News in the lead-up to the election. But faced with the reality of Trump\u2019s policies, it appears to be the best spin that some conservatives can muster. Now that the cat is officially out of the bag, many contributors and hosts on the president\u2019s favorite news network, Fox News, and its sister channel, Fox Business, seem to have rallied around a common conclusion: Pain is on the horizon.

Goldman's own economics team recently revised down its 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from a prior projection of 2.2% as impacts from tariffs and political uncertainty have weighed on the outlook. \"Our revised estimates reflect the recently reduced GDP growth forecast of our US Economics team, a higher assumed tariff rate, and higher level of uncertainty that is typically associated with a greater equity risk premium,\" Kostin wrote. Earlier this week, the S&P 500 nearly entered correction territory \u2014 defined as a 10% drop from its most recent high \u2014 as fears about the health of the US economy and uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policy shook investor confidence. \"We lower our 2025 year-end S&P 500 index target to 6200 (from 6500) to reflect a 4% reduction in our modeled fair-value forward P/E multiple (20.6x from 21.5x),\" Kostin and his team wrote.

If that occurs, we see a 'growth scare' of a 14-20% decline from peak as most likely, which could shift us into our bear case.\" And late Tuesday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin became the first big name on the Street to lower their year-end price target for the S&P 500 following this drop, with Kostin cutting his year-end target to 6,200 from 6,500. AOL \"Our new index target suggests an 11% price gain during the balance of the year, similar to our return estimate at the start of the year but from a lower starting point.\" Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Cost control measures helped alleviate the impact of lower sales volumes and adverse exchange rate effects. The adjusted EBITDA3 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) for this segment was CHF 79.1 million, compared to CHF 105.5 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.6% of sales, compared to 22.9% in 2023. 2 The calculation of 2024 adjusted net profit and adjusted earnings per share excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 16.4 million) and accumulated amortization of acquired intangible assets (+CHF 19.0 million) and they were calculated with the reported Group tax rate of 13.6%. Adjusted net profit2 was CHF 103.1 million, down from CHF 164.4 million in 2023, when earnings were significantly boosted by a one-time positive effect related to transitional measures from the Swiss tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were CHF 8.08, compared to CHF 12.88 in 2023. Information by business segment Tecan will hold an analyst and media conference to discuss the 2024 annual results today at 09:00 (CET). The presentation will also be relayed by live audio webcast, which interested parties can access at www.tecan.com under Investor Relations. A link to the webcast will be provided immediately prior to the event. Based on the solid cash flows for the full year 2024 and on the basis of an ongoing positive business outlook, the Board of Directors will propose at the Company's Annual General Meeting on April 18, 2024, an unchanged dividend of CHF 3.00 per share. Half of the dividend, i.e., CHF 1.50, will again be paid out from the available capital contribution reserve and is therefore not subject to withholding tax.

Examples include Tecan's collaboration with Illumina in the Synergence line, supporting their expansion into multi-omics with the development of a new system. Through Paramit, Tecan assisted THINK\u00ae Surgical with the design transfer and initiated the manufacturing of their TMINI\u00ae miniature robotic system, cart, and smart cell charging station. Additionally, Paramit is manufacturing the Avive Connect AED, an innovative and user-friendly automated external defibrillator aimed at improving survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest. The Partnering Business generated sales of CHF 537.3 million in 2024 (2023: CHF 622.6 million or CHF 613.1 million in local currencies), marking a decrease of 13.7% in Swiss francs and 12.4% in local currencies. As anticipated, Tecan did not record any meaningful sales from the pass-through of material costs in this segment for 2024, compared to CHF 8.0 million in 2023. About Tecan Tecan CEO Dr. Achim von Leoprechting commented: \"Tecan is navigating a challenging market environment marked by reduced spending in our target markets, leading to lower demand in both the Life Sciences and Partnering Business segments. These challenges have been compounded by general market weakness in China and specific customer-related factors. In response, we have implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program and optimized our global operations to reinforce our leading position. The long-term trends in healthcare remain unchanged: from life science research to clinical applications, automation and innovation are crucial for scaling healthcare solutions in research, clinical diagnostics, and medtech. This is especially important amid rising healthcare costs, ultimately benefiting people worldwide. With our dedicated team, we are driving exciting innovations and look forward to launching promising new products across both businesses, positioning us well to capitalize on market recovery as conditions improve.\" In 2024, Tecan enhanced its operational resilience by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and continuing to optimize its global organizational footprint. Following the successful transfer of Cavro component production to facilities in Morgan Hill, California, and Penang, Malaysia, and the closure of the San Jose site in 2023, Tecan relocated its genomic reagents site from Redwood City to the expanding Morgan Hill hub at the end of 2024. In Penang, Tecan successfully passed an extensive FDA inspection, laying a strong foundation for future production of medical devices, including class 3 devices. The first medical device production was successfully transitioned to Penang in 2024. Alongside site consolidation, Tecan focused on supply chain optimization and increased vertical integration of manufacturing to leverage the Group's full capabilities and realize cost synergies. Innovation and product launches in the Life Sciences Business In 2024, Tecan demonstrated its commitment to agile cost management amid evolving economic conditions and revenue trends by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and optimizing its global organizational footprint. These efforts are designed to protect profitability without limiting the company's growth potential. As a result, Tecan forecasts an adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding restructuring, acquisition- and integration-related costs, of 17.5-18.5% of sales. Outlook Adjusted EBITDA1 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) was CHF 164.4 million, down from CHF 220.6 million in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 17.6% of sales (2023: 20.5%), aligning with the revised margin outlook of 16-18%. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, as profitability is highly volume-dependent. However, profitability was supported by a comprehensive cost-reduction program. Additionally, exchange rate movements in major currencies against the Swiss franc negatively impacted the margin by approximately 40 basis points. Order entry in the Partnering Business for the full year decreased slightly more than sales as OEM customers adjusted their ordering patterns, shifting from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Despite this shift, the book-to-bill ratio remained close to 1. Further building on sustainability activities Sales of CHF\u00a0934.3 million (2023: CHF\u00a01,074.4 million), down by -13.0% in Swiss francs and by -11.5% in local currencies; H2 sales decrease by -11.3% in local currenciesDecline in sales mainly due to softness in the instrument business with biopharmaceutical companies globally and general market weakness in ChinaAdjusted EBITDA of CHF 164.4 million (2023: CHF 220.6 million), adjusted EBITDA margin reached 17.6% (2023: 20.5%)Margins declined due to lower sales volume, but were partly offset by cost-reduction measuresAdjusted net profit of CHF\u00a0103.1 million (2023: CHF\u00a0164.4 million), adjusted earnings per share of CHF\u00a08.08 (2023: CHF\u00a012.88)Proposal for a stable dividend of CHF 3.00 per share Operating cash flow of CHF 148.5 million (2023: CHF 160.6 million), cash conversion increased to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%) The adjusted EBITDA3 for this segment was CHF 91.1 million, compared to CHF 125.6 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.9% of sales, compared to 20.1% in 2023. M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland, March 12, 2025 - The Tecan Group (SIX Swiss Exchange: TECN) today announced its full set of audited financial results for 2024, underscoring its commitment to enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions. The company also initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025. Proposal for a stable dividend at the Annual General Meeting The full 2024 Annual Report and the 2024 Sustainability Report were also published today and can be accessed on the company's website www.tecan.com under Investor Relations. On the commercial front, Tecan established a direct sales office in South Korea in 2024 by acquiring a long-standing distributor in the region. This new entity includes team members with over 20 years of experience working with Tecan, bringing valuable local market knowledge to better serve this growing market. In 2024, reduced spending in the biopharmaceutical industry led to decreased demand for life science research instruments, affecting both the Life Sciences Business and the Partnering Business. Additionally, a general market weakness in China impacted both direct sales and indirect business through global OEM customers. In the Partnering Business, sales were further influenced by specific customer-related factors, including normalized demand patterns following inventory replenishment by a key customer in 2023. As a result, reported sales for the Group in fiscal year 2024 decreased by 13.0% in Swiss francs, totaling CHF 934.3 million (2023: CHF 1,074.4 million). In local currencies, sales were 11.5% below the prior-year period, aligning with the revised sales outlook from October 2024, which anticipated a decline of 12-14%. Sales in the second half decreased by 12.3% in Swiss francs and by 11.3% in local currencies compared to the prior-year period. These sales results were previously communicated in a trading statement on January 8, 2025. New launches and rich project pipeline in Partnering Business Tecan's 2024 Sustainability Report, published as part of the Annual Report, includes a Climate Risk Scenarios Analysis, highlighting the company's proactive approach to addressing transition and physical risks related to climate change. In preparation for the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Tecan has integrated related data management into its Finance function. For the first time, Tecan's financial auditors conducted a limited assurance audit of key 2024 environmental and social data points. Further progress was made towards greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, with renewable sources accounting for 87% of all electricity purchased. In 2025, Tecan will continue its pragmatic approach to managing risks and opportunities associated with the company's material topics.

Tel. +41 (0) 44 922 84 30 Highlights 2024 The dial-in numbers for the conference call are as follows: Reported EBIT amounted to CHF\u00a046.6 million (2023: CHF\u00a064.4 million), while the reported operating profit margin reached 8.7% of sales (2023: 10.3%). Similar to the Life Sciences Business segment, lower sales volumes and the resulting negative economies of scale were the main factors affecting margin development. The Annual General Meeting of Tecan's shareholders will take place on April 10, 2025A Q1 2025 Qualitative Update will be published on May 12, 2025The 2025 Interim Report will be published on August 12, 2025A Q3 2025 Qualitative Update will be published on October 13, 2025 1 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 16.4 million) Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications & IR Key upcoming dates Financial results for the full year 2024 - Highlights The expectations regarding profitability are based on an average exchange rate forecast for full year 2025 of one euro equaling CHF 0.95 and one US dollar equaling CHF 0.90. Tecan Group www.tecan.com [email\u00a0protected] The outlook 2025 does not take account of potential acquisitions during the course of the year. Tecan also expanded its digital ecosystem with the new Introspect analytics platform, enhancing operational insights and service efficiency. This digital expansion benefits customers across both business segments. The pipeline of new development projects has been further enriched through joint selling of Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit services, targeting key customers in the life sciences, lab diagnostics, and Medtech segments. Tecan aims to double new project signings by 2027 through joint selling efforts, a targeted approach, and strategic account management. The lower demand for life science instrumentation also had a negative impact on the Partnering Business, influencing both the Cavro\u00ae OEM components business and the contract development and manufacturing revenues for life science instruments in the Paramit product line. Market weakness in China also impacted the Cavro OEM components business and sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence\u2122 product line to larger global OEM customers with significant exposure to China. However, outside China, sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence product line developed positively, with increased contributions from newly launched systems. Sales in the Paramit product line, which served medical market customers, were negatively affected by normalized demand patterns following the replenishment of depleted inventories in 2023, when supply chain disruptions eased, and by the anticipated reduction in sales from the pure pass-through of material costs. These impacts were specific to a single customer and included a model transition, rather than being related to end market conditions. All these factors had a more pronounced impact in the second half of the year, when segment sales decreased by 15.9% in local currencies. Tecan (www.tecan.com) improves people's lives and health by empowering customers to scale healthcare innovation globally from life science to the clinic. Tecan is a pioneer and global leader in laboratory automation. As an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Tecan is also a leader in developing and manufacturing OEM instruments, components and medical devices that are then distributed by partner companies. Founded in Switzerland in 1980, the company has 3,300 employees, with manufacturing, research and development sites in Europe, North America and Asia, and maintains a sales and service network in over 70 countries. In 2024, Tecan generated sales of CHF 934 million (USD 1,062 million; EUR 984 million). Registered shares of Tecan Group are traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange (TECN; ISIN CH0012100191). Press Release with financial tables Enhancing operational resilience through cost-reduction initiatives, while expanding global operations and commercial reach Sales in the Life Sciences Business in 2024 reached CHF 397.0 million (2023: CHF 451.8 million or CHF 442.1 million in local currencies), reflecting a decrease of 12.1% in Swiss francs and 10.2% in local currencies. Reduced CAPEX spending by the biopharmaceutical industry globally, along with government and academic customers in the US, resulted in decreased demand for life science research instruments. Additionally, market weakness in China negatively impacted demand, as the announced stimulus program failed to provide any impetus in 2024. Instead, it prompted some customers to delay orders while awaiting funding decisions. Contributing to a more favorable sales development in the Life Sciences Business were recovering consumables sales post-pandemic, a solid service business due to a higher installed base of instruments, and continued strong demand for newly launched products, particularly from genomic diagnostics companies. Recurring sales of services, consumables and reagents increased to 57.6% of segment sales (2023: 52.8%). Attachment 3 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Life Sciences Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 6.4 million). The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Partnering Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 5.3 million). Life Sciences Business (end-customer business) Tecan also reiterated its mid-term outlook, in which the company anticipates returning to average organic growth rates in the mid to high single-digit percentage range in local currencies under normal market conditions, while continuously improving profitability. In the second half of 2024, the Life Sciences Business segment experienced moderate order entry growth in local currencies compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio slightly above 1 for the full year. The overall market environment is showing first signs of stabilization after a significant decline in demand last year, with further improvements expected over the course of 2025. However, new political uncertainties have emerged, including the announced reductions to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research budget in the US, which could further impact demand for life science research instruments. For 2025, Tecan anticipates that the year will begin with continued softer market conditions, with potential improvement as the year progresses. Depending on the extent of this improvement in the second half, the market could turn slightly positive for the full year, driven by specific growth segments, such as the clinical diagnostics market. Acknowledging the current market conditions, Tecan has initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025, with a full-year guidance range from a low single-digit decline to low single-digit growth in sales in local currencies. The company expects sales in local currencies to decline in the first half, with a softer first quarter and a sequential improvement in the second quarter. A more positive outlook for the second half is supported by a strong reception of newly launched products and partnerships in both divisions, along with additional launches in 2025. Financial results full-year and second half of 2024 Annual Report and Webcast Cash flow from operating activities was CHF 148.5 million, compared to CHF 160.6 million in 2023. Cash conversion improved to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%). Thanks to solid cash flow management, Tecan's net liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term time deposits, less bank liabilities, loans, and the outstanding bond) increased to CHF 153.7 million as of December 31, 2024, up from CHF 112.6 million on December 31, 2023. In 2024, Tecan advanced its product portfolio with significant launches in genomics, proteomics, and cell biology. Examples include the Resolvex i300 module, introduced in February, which enhances throughput in proteomics by integrating with the Fluent\u00ae platform, and the Spark Cyto 3D, which supports drug discovery by enabling the analysis of complex 3D cell models. During a Capital Markets Day in October 2024, Tecan previewed Veya\u2122, a multi-omics liquid handling workstation that simplifies lab automation and boosts productivity. Officially launched at the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (SLAS) international conference in San Diego, USA, in January 2025, Veya provides effortless automation by overcoming key barriers in lab automation. In the second half of the year, sales declined by 5.0% in local currencies, following the sharp 15.5% decline in the first half. Sequentially, the Life Sciences Business segment grew by 13.6% in local currencies when comparing the second half of 2024 to the first half. Martin Br\u00e4ndle For further information: Tecan reports 2024 financial results, enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions Full-year order entry was CHF 903.6 million, a decrease of 12.1% compared to CHF 1,028.1 million in 2023, reflecting a 10.5% decline in local currencies. The Partnering Business segment was impacted by a shift in OEM customer ordering patterns, moving from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Meanwhile, the Life Sciences Business segment saw moderate order entry growth in local currencies in the second half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, the Group's order entry in the second half decreased by 11.2% in local currencies.", "https://www.twincities.com/2025/03/12/trump-stock-market-quotes/": " SATURDAYS Dec. 16, 2024, during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago Trump was asked whether he is concerned that his tariffs might hurt the stock market. \u201cSTOCK MARKETS CRASHING.

It'll just take a moment. A day after Hatzius issued his research note, President Trump announced that an additional 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum will go into effect on Wednesday. The policy change likely will result in higher prices for U.S. manufacturers that rely on Canadian imports. Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius cut his 2025 U.S. GDP growth forecast to 1.7%, pointing to the impact of tariffs on the economy and consumers. At the start of this year, he was predicting 2.4% growth. You are just one step away from creating your watchlist! Tariffs may also spur inflation. Hatzius anticipates that the core Personal Consumption Expenditure price index (core PCE) may reaccelerate to 3% later this year, up nearly half a percentage point from his prior forecast. \u201cIn theory, a tariff hike raises the price level permanently but only raises the inflation rate temporarily. In practice, this hinges on the assumption that inflation expectations remain well-anchored, which looks a bit more tenuous following the pickup in the UMich and Conference Board inflation expectations measures,\" he writes, referring to the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index, which shows sentiment souring. Although Trump campaigned on implementing far-reaching tariffs, the president\u2019s policy announcements seem to have caught investors off guard and sent markets tumbling. So far this year, the S&P 500 is down 5.1%, and the Nasdaq has fallen 9.7%. The selloff wiped out gains stocks made after Election Day when investors focused on aspects of the president\u2019s agenda deemed more pro-growth, such as deregulation and tax cuts. Consumer discretionary and bank stocks, which are seen as economically sensitive, have been among the hardest hit. Your session has expired, please login again. In a March 10 research note, Hatzius said \u201ctrade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse and the administration is managing expectations toward tariff-induced near-term economic weakness.\" He now expects the average U.S. tariff rate to rise by 10 percentage points this year, twice his previous forecast and about five times the increase seen in the first administration of President Donald Trump. The outlook for the U.S. economy this year isn\u2019t so rosy anymore. Those tariffs join a burgeoning list of tariff increases that Trump has unveiled on roughly $1.4 trillion worth of goods coming from Canada, Mexico, and China. Those three countries are the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partners. The president has temporarily paused some of the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods until April. Hatzius notes that tariffs can dampen economic growth because they raise consumer prices and thereby cut real income. Tariffs also tend to tighten financial conditions, and trade policy uncertainty leads firms to delay investment, he writes. Hatzius estimates that tariffs will subtract 0.8 of a percentage point from GDP growth over the next year. Potential tax cuts and regulatory easing, which are seen as pro-growth, will only offset 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points of this drag, he says. You are now subscribed to our newsletters.

Goldman's own economics team recently revised down its 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from a prior projection of 2.2% as impacts from tariffs and political uncertainty have weighed on the outlook. \"Our revised estimates reflect the recently reduced GDP growth forecast of our US Economics team, a higher assumed tariff rate, and higher level of uncertainty that is typically associated with a greater equity risk premium,\" Kostin wrote. Earlier this week, the S&P 500 nearly entered correction territory \u2014 defined as a 10% drop from its most recent high \u2014 as fears about the health of the US economy and uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policy shook investor confidence. \"We lower our 2025 year-end S&P 500 index target to 6200 (from 6500) to reflect a 4% reduction in our modeled fair-value forward P/E multiple (20.6x from 21.5x),\" Kostin and his team wrote. Advertisement \"Weaker economic activity usually means weaker corporate earnings growth.\" Kostin noted a catalyst that improves the economic growth outlook, either evidenced by stronger economic data or a reduced tariff policy plan that could spur an upturn in stocks. On Wednesday, perhaps the first sign of better economic data emerged as a softer-than-expected inflation reading sent the major stock indexes higher at the market open. For premium support please call: A nearly 10% fall in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has prompted Wall Street strategists to revaluate their bullish views headed into 2025. \"The risks of a drawdown of more than 10% have admittedly grown, however. If that occurs, we see a 'growth scare' of a 14-20% decline from peak as most likely, which could shift us into our bear case.\" And late Tuesday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin became the first big name on the Street to lower their year-end price target for the S&P 500 following this drop, with Kostin cutting his year-end target to 6,200 from 6,500.

The US is the best because it generally values freedom, opportunity, productivity based salaries for productive employees and shareholder returns for investors over employee rights in non productivity (i.e. unions, termination etc) and taxes for the state. Should we consider selling my international equities given their recent strength and increase my allocation to US equities? The US market is the most innovative in the world, and I believe this trend will continue for many years. You\u2019ve frequently emphasized the strong fundamentals and earnings growth of the largest US companies in the S&P 500. Name How about some \u201cnon-phlegmatic non-responses\u201d on the part of this poster? How does just stop posting the regular tripe sound?

From Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman on Trump: A Mind is a Terrible thing to Lose, Especially When you are Running a Country For the last year, much of the rest of the world was ignored as money chased the shiny US market.  Now investors from outside the US are starting to look closer to home and other places. I like today\u2019s picture.The old geazer stuck in 1978.What a dawg. Although the US market has the strongest fundamentals, its current valuations are considerably higher than historical averages. Given the above-average return on equity for the largest S&P 500 companies, these valuations might be justified. However, when expectations are high and results don\u2019t meet investors\u2019 expectations, valuations may contract leading to disappointing investment returns. Therefore, strong fundamentals alone don\u2019t always translate to strong returns, making it very important to manage risks and diversify. aahh\u2026 more taxpayer money getting flushed down the toilet \u2026 anyone going to reimburse the tax payer? any government official going to lose their job? ? We have had quite a bout of US financial and economic exceptionalism over the last few years that quite possibly is coming to an end because of high valuations and chaotic government policy.  So it may be the time to look elsewhere. Quote of the day: \u201cInvesting is a personal journey, and just as everyone has different comfort zones in life, they also have unique thresholds in the world of finance.

I personally think it is to deregulate American banks.  It\u2019s happening in the background and no one is paying attention.  Michael Barr is now gone.

Sometimes I think my returns would be better if I just bought the S&P and fell asleep.

FACT: They have triggered a global recession. So far in 2025, international equity markets are outperforming the US equity market leading some to wonder whether international equities might finally end the 16-year streak of US outperformance\u2014the longest in history\u2014or if this trend is merely temporary. As an investor, the next market I think will start having blowout growth is China.  It is currently worth 1/5th of the US market cap but what that country lacks in freedoms, it makes up in long term planning and is similarly focused on productivity, not pandering to unproductive people and is working hard to build trust in it\u2019s markets to attract more international capital. The belt and road initiative expanding it\u2019s reach plus all the R&D going on there will result in undeniable global winners in major industries eventually, similar to Japan in the 80s. This isn\u2019t great if you are bad at your job and get fired, want to be protected by a Union or work in Government. But the opportunity present in the US business environment attracts the best of the best from around the world to solve hard problems and solving those problems results in the highest returns that attract capital flows to invest in solving those problems on US soil as well. The political chattering in China is that CCP loves to work with President Trump, but not much with those hypocrites like the ones in the previous administration. FACT: It\u2019s only possible for prices to rise when a Democrat is president. Just in case you\u2019re trying to make sense of all this.  It\u2019s a strategy to paralyze the media and masses. Just let him think he\u2019s good at something and that we care about his deep thoughts.

Hendrik Bessembinder, a professor of finance at Arizona State University, conducted a research study analyzing long-term shareholder returns for over 64,000 global common stocks from January 1990 to December 2020.

The long-term performance of the US equity market over the next 20+ years will likely be close to it\u2019s historical average. However, there will likely be years when the US market significantly underperforms compared to international markets. Historically, US and international markets have moved in cycles, as illustrated in this chart. We\u2019ll probably sit on an 80% US portfolio weighting for the time being and continue with ongoing Canadian active business/private equity as the main income stream, while, of course, watching and waiting. Referring to the person who birthed your children as \u201cthe\u201d wife reeks of the deprecatory \u201cthe little woman\u201d attitude. Given this, why should we invest in markets with comparatively weaker fundamentals? It seems that focusing primarily on the US market might yield higher total returns over the long term for my portfolio. Moreover, with S&P 500 companies generating around 40% of their revenue from international markets, isn\u2019t that already providing sufficient international diversification? What an infantile platitude. Investing globally enhances sector diversification, which has varied significantly in the US market over the past few decades. Currently, one-third of the US market is concentrated in the technology sector. Although the US market is home to many innovative companies, technological advancements can happen rapidly, and new innovators can emerge globally, as demonstrated by the recent rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence company. By diversifying internationally, investors can access a broader range of sectors worldwide, including vital sectors like energy and materials, which are less prominent in the US equity market. My wife is fine. So is my partner if you must but the person who casually uses \u201cthe\u201d wife will someday meet the person he could have been and then comes the realization coupled with the existential dread, that this attitude lasts forever and forever makes one a total shart.

While some may argue that long-term returns are what truly matter, the real challenge for most investors is staying invested during negative years. Many investors struggle with annual losses, and enduring 3-5+ years of negative annualized performance in the equity portion of a portfolio can be particularly challenging. This often leads to emotional decisions and abandoning long-term investment plans. By diversifying investments across various markets, investors can mitigate the impact of poor performance in any single market and ensure they remain invested to capture the long-term rate of return. MYTH: Tariffs will help crack down on illegal drugs entering at the borders. Tesla\u2019s stock has suffered, with a 55% drop from mid-December highs.

Although US multinationals generate a substantial portion of their revenues from international markets, they lack exposure to certain regions, particularly some emerging markets. Global diversification provides access to growth opportunities in these emerging markets, which have significant growth potential due to their expanding economies and increasing consumer bases.

The administration also decided on March 6 that items covered by a trade deal known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement would be removed from the tariff until April 2. The Trump administration is imposing 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Wednesday. This comes despite exclusion requests from exporting countries, including Japan. He signed an executive order imposing 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 4. But one day before the levy was scheduled to come into force, he disclosed a one-month pause. Financial markets have been reeling from a series of shifts in tariff policies by US President Donald Trump. The US leader has vowed to use tariffs to win concessions from trading partners on a range of issues. The tariff took effect on March 4, but the Trump administration announced on the following day that automobiles would be excluded from the duty for a month.

Signs of moderating growth and easing inflation have prompted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to act. The central bank recently cut its key interest rate for the first time in nearly five years, lowering the repo rate from 6.5 percent to 6.25 percent to help counter slowing growth. We expect further rate cuts over the next five years. Markets have been increasingly pricing in a potential US recession. But \"we disagree,\" said Ben Powell of BlackRock Investment Institute in an interview to Moneycontrol. We see trade protectionism emerging as a key risk under the new US administration. For India, however, the impact of potential US tariffs look relatively contained \u2014 goods exports to the US make up less than 5 percent of its GDP, according to World Bank data. This suggests India is far less exposed to direct trade disruptions than economies more dependent on US demand. As we rethink investing in our outlook, we believe that valuations are not that stretched, as we look beyond current valuations in this transformation. Valuations tend to matter more for returns over a long-term horizon than in the near term. Some US equity valuation measures \u2013 whether price-to-earnings ratios or equity risk premiums \u2013 look rich relative to history. But they may not tell the full story. The equity market\u2019s changing sectoral composition reflects the transformation taking hold. So, comparing today's index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges. Home Currencies Commodities Pre-Market IPO Global Market Bonds Inflation cooled across developed markets in 2024, but structural forces did the hard work, rather than central bank rate hikes -- notably, the post-pandemic normalisation of the goods and labour markets, and an unexpected rise in US immigration that expanded the labour force. We think persistent inflation pressures mean that the Fed will need to keep rates high for longer, with no more than one or two cuts this year. We see the Fed\u2019s policy changes as a recalibration of policy back towards a neutral level, rather than a traditional \u2018rate cutting cycle\u2019 as part of a business cycle. The US and India agreed to launch bilateral trade talks for the first time. The outcome remains unclear \u2014 whether a formal treaty or a mix of tariff and regulatory agreements. Even if retaliatory tariffs were imposed, we believe the economic impact would remain limited. Stock Markets Follow us on: Powered By The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 6.5 percent GDP (gross domestic product) growth for India in 2025 \u2014 well above the global and emerging market averages. Powell expects this economic outperformance to continue, driven by structural strengths, such as favourable demographics and rising productivity. We believe structural shifts underway in India map neatly onto the five mega forces we see shaping the world now and in the future. These shifts include its demographic advantage, supercharged digitisation and resilience in navigating a fragmented geopolitical landscape. Last week\u2019s US jobs report showed the pace of job creation has eased somewhat, but if immigration slows back towards historical levels \u2013 and we some evidence it is already slowing \u2013 job creation would need to slow quite a bit further to prevent inflation picking up. Indeed, wage pressures are still too high for inflation to settle back at the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. India\u2019s turning investment and capex cycle, along with recovering rural consumption, underpin long-term structural positives. The capex cycle is driven by strong corporate and government balance sheets and a robust pipeline of projects in utilities, renewables, manufacturing, and real estate.

Sensex Today  US CPI Inflation Haryana Election Results Pakistan Train Hijack Trump Tesla Car Haldiram Tesla Market cap Jio Starlink News Rohit Sharma SLPRB Assam Constable Result What matters more for near-term growth are pains due to elevated uncertainty, including a potential US government shutdown. The markets expect weaker US growth to push the Fed to cut policy rates, as in a typical business cycle. Yet, we see a tough trade-off between supporting growth and curbing sticky inflation, limiting how much the Fed can cut. That reinforces our expectation of policy rates above the pre-pandemic levels and higher bond yields. We advocate above-benchmark allocations to Indian equities within strategic portfolios with investment horizons of five years or more as the country\u2019s economic transformation unfolds. The US briefly rolled out the largest tariffs in nearly a century on March 4 -- 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian and Mexican imports and an extra 10 percent on China. While most North American tariffs were later put on ice for another month, we think an average effective tariff rate of about 10 percent could be the eventual landing zone \u2013 with volatility along the way.

After a\u00a010% rally in its share price\u00a0over the past year, the\u00a0average SPY price target\u00a0of $710.68 per share implies 27.8% upside potential. Indices Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers thinks there\u2019s an almost 50% that the U.S. will enter into a recession this year. He believes this is because of changes made by the Trump administration and uncertainty in the markets. Indeed, Summers says that the U.S. has a big problem with uncertainty, and it won\u2019t be easy to fix. This uncertainty is making it hard for businesses to make decisions and for consumers to feel confident about spending money. Stocks Currencies See SPY\u2019s holdings Commodities Interestingly, Summers pointed to Latin America\u2019s economic history as an example of how protectionist policies can go wrong. He says that while protectionism might seem like a good idea in the short term, it usually ends up hurting the economy in the long term. Summers also thinks that businesses are too uncertain about what will happen next to invest in new projects or hire new employees, which will make it hard for the economy to grow. Summers points to some specific reasons why he thinks a recession might happen. These include new immigration rules, government layoffs, and tariffs on imported goods. Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration thinks the economy will be okay and that any short-term problems will be followed by growth. However, Summers disagrees, and said that the administration\u2019s policies will ultimately hurt the economy. He also thinks that the Fed\u2019s efforts to cut interest rates might not be enough to help the economy grow.", "https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/white-collar-and-enforcement-outlook-4076317/": " Similarly, the Criminal Division\u2019s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) was directed to prioritize investigations, prosecutions, and asset forfeiture actions that target the activities of cartels and TCOs. [9] Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, No. 22-2254, at *i (Apr. 5, 2024). During oral argument on December 9, 2024, the Justices grappled with the bounds (or lack thereof) of the Government\u2019s theory of the case. Petitioners argued that the government\u2019s interpretation would be limitless, criminalizing everyday white lies, puffery, and other fraudulent promises to induce people to enter into transactions, even if there is no monetary loss. The Government pointed to the text of the statute where a financial-loss element is \u201cnowhere to be found,\u201d countering that the petitioners\u2019 theory would eliminate the government\u2019s ability to prosecute \u201cparadigmatic fraud,\u201d whereby people are deprived of their property based on fraudulent misrepresentations. Ultimately, the Justices appeared divided on the question as both sides were peppered with probing questions and difficult hypotheticals, the answers to which appeared satisfactory to no one. Whatever decision the Court reaches, it will likely have wide-ranging implications on the scope of the federal fraud statutes. In addition, Attorney General Bondi issued a memorandum that: (1) reinstated the prohibition on improper third-party settlements; (2) rescinded the May 5, 2022, Memorandum from the Attorney General entitled \u201cGuidelines and Limitations for Settlement Agreements Involving Payments to Non-Governmental Third Parties\u201d; and (3) rescinded the July 28, 2023, Memorandum from the Assistant Attorney General for the Environmental and Natural Resources Division entitled \u201cCommunity Service Payments in Environmental Crimes Cases.\u201d Attorney General Bondi\u2019s memorandum signals a realignment with the previous Trump DOJ initiatives prohibiting such third-party settlements. [3] Section 951 of Title 18, a statute sometimes charged alongside FARA, generally requires agents operating under control of a foreign government or foreign official (other than diplomats and other limited exceptions) to notify the Attorney General before acting. Back to Top Explore 2025 Readers' Choice Awards Consistent with President Trump\u2019s executive orders, the DOJ has prioritized efforts to dismantle DEI/DEIA initiatives in the private sector and at educational institutions that receive federal funds. Attorney General Bondi tasked the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division and Office of Legal Policy to prepare a report by March 1concerning recommendations for enforcement actions against DEI/DEIA practices, including the proposal of criminal and civil compliance investigations. The DOJ also emphasized its commitment to eliminating what it deemed internal \u201cillegal\u201d DEIA policies and rescinding materials supporting race- or sex-based preferences. \u00a9ArentFox Schiff Attorney General Bondi established the Joint Task Force October 7 (JTF 10-7) to seek justice for victims of the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel, in part by pursuing criminal charges against the perpetrators and those responsible for funding Hamas. The memorandum suspends Justice Manual \u00a7 9-13.525, which required prior approval from the DOJ\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs before issuing subpoenas or other unilateral compulsory measures regarding evidence or information located abroad. This directive will allow the JTF 10-7 to issue administrative subpoenas to foreign banks with correspondent accounts in the United States without prior approval from Main Justice in Washington, DC.

To achieve \u201ctotal elimination\u201d Attorney General Bondi issued a \u201cTotal Elimination of Cartels and Transnational Criminal Organization Directive\u201d that provides guidance on charging decisions, removes \u201cbureaucratic roadblocks,\u201d directs prosecutors to focus on FCPA and FARA investigations with connections to TCOs, gangs, and cartels, and shifts resources. The focal point of the DOJ\u2019s new priorities is its \u201cambitious and historic mission\u201d to eliminate MS-13, TdA, and international drug cartels. The DOJ\u2019s prioritization of TOCs, cartels, and gangs follows President Trump\u2019s Executive Order 14157, \u201cDesignating Cartels and other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists,\u201d issued on his first day in office, which creates a process to designate cartels and TCOs as terrorists.[1] [6] United States v. Thompson, 89 F.4th 1010 (7th Cir.), cert. granted, 145 S. Ct. 116 (2024). With two highly anticipated decisions in Kousisis v. United States[5] and Thompson v. United States[6] coming this term, the Supreme Court may add to its growing list of rulings narrowing the scope of federal criminal fraud statutes[7], resolving two circuit splits along the way. Both cases could have significant implications on the scope of the federal fraud statutes. Attorney General Bondi set forth a number of directives and initiatives to combat transnational organized crime, cartels and gangs, illegal immigration, and human trafficking and smuggling. Diverting Resources and Dissolving Task Forces: Attorney General Bondi redirected resources, and directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to shift resources from alcohol- and tobacco-related enforcement to \u201cwidespread illegal immigration, dangerous cartels, [and] transnational organized crime.\u201d This push to reallocate resources resulted in the dissolution of several DOJ task forces and enforcement units, including (1) the National Security Division Corporate Enforcement Unit, established during the Biden Administration to investigate corporate economic sanctions and export controls violations; (2) the Russia-Focused KleptoCapture Task Force and the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, created following the Russian invasion of Ukraine to enforce sanctions and export control restrictions on Russian oligarchs evading certain measures; and (3) the Foreign Influence Task Force, which was created in 2017 to police disinformation campaigns. Refine your interests \u00bb [7] These cases include: Ciminelli v. United States, 598 US 306 (2023); Percoco v. United States, 598 US 319 (2023); McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987); Skilling v. United States, 561 US 358 (2010); Cleveland v. United States, 531 US 12 (2000); McDonnell v. United States, 579 US 550 (2016); and Kelly v. United States, 590 US 391 (2020). In Kousisis, the Supreme Court is once again considering the scope of the wire fraud statute. The petitioners in Kousisis were charged with various counts of wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, and false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343, 1349, and 1001, respectively, arising out of allegations of false statements made with respect to compliance with certain conditions of a government contract. According to the government, the petitioners fraudulently induced the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) to award, and pay under, two lucrative contracts that included a condition requiring participation of a disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE). Even though the petitioners performed the work as promised, they did not comply with the contracts\u2019 DBE requirements, and thus committed wire fraud, among other things. The petitioners argued that the government received the benefit of the bargain, and the only alleged harm \u2014 frustration of the government\u2019s interest in promoting diversity through DBE contracting programs \u2014 is not a traditional property interest to support a wire fraud charge. FCPA and FARA Enforcement: The Attorney General directed the Criminal Division\u2019s FCPA Unit to \u201cprioritize investigations related to foreign bribery that facilitates the criminal operations of Cartels and TCOs,\u201d such as \u201cbribery of foreign officials to facilitate human smuggling and the trafficking of narcotics and firearms.\u201d Attorney General Bondi called for US Attorneys\u2019 Offices to \u201chave full and immediate access to the most serious and broad charges that Congress has made available\u201d and US Attorneys\u2019 Offices no longer need to obtain approval from the Criminal Division for an FCPA investigation or prosecution if the case relates to foreign bribery associated with TCOs and Cartels.[2] The DOJ\u2019s new enforcement priorities include illegal immigration, human smuggling, and transnational crime organizations (TCOs), gangs, and cartels. In support of these priorities, the DOJ will prioritize Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) actions with connections to TCOs, gangs, and cartels, although it remains to be seen whether this prioritization will be to the exclusion of other enforcement actions, and if so, to what extent. In furtherance of the DOJ\u2019s new priorities, Attorney General Bondi eliminated several task forces and enforcement units that were drawing resources elsewhere, including the National Security Division\u2019s Corporate Enforcement Unit, the Foreign Influence Task Force, the KleptoCapture Task Force, and the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. Additionally, Attorney General Bondi established the Weaponization Working Group to \u201cidentify instances where a department\u2019s or agency\u2019s conduct appears to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims\u201d over the last four years. The memorandum enumerates objectives to examine, including improper investigative tactics and unethical prosecutions related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack; a review of Special Counsel Jack Smith and his staff related to search warrant execution at President Trump\u2019s home; and the extent of federal cooperation with New York officials in their pursuit of President Trump, and his family and businesses. Copyright \u00a9  JD Supra, LLC As part of the Trump Administration\u2019s overall shift in environmental policy, it released the Executive Order entitled \u201cInitial Rescission of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions\u201d and revoked previous Executive Orders[10] deemed by the Trump Administration to be promoting \u201cclimate extremism.\u201d In support, Attorney General Bondi issued a memorandum rescinding prior memoranda, guidance, and directives that implemented the Biden Administration\u2019s \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d initiative. In addition to effectuating many of President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders, Attorney General Bondi reinstituted prior Trump Administration guidance and established task forces and working groups. The question before the Supreme Court is, \u201cWhether deception to induce a commercial exchange can constitute mail or wire fraud, even if inflicting economic harm on the alleged victim was not the object of the scheme.\u201d[8] [10] Executive Order 13990 (Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis) and Executive Order 14099 (Revitalizing Our Nation\u2019s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All). Attorney General Bondi also instructed the DOJ to limit and minimize its enforcement of violations of FARA unrelated to the goal of combatting cartels and TCOs. She directed FARA prosecutors to both limit the \u201c[r]ecourse to criminal charges under the [FARA] and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 951 to instances of alleged conduct similar to more traditional espionage by foreign government actors\u201d and to also \u201cfocus on civil enforcement, regulatory initiatives, and public guidance\u201d rather than criminal prosecutions.[3] In light of the DOJ\u2019s new priorities, corporations should take the time and opportunity to reassess their (1) hiring and employment practices, particularly recordkeeping policies to ensure compliance with federal immigration laws; and (2) compliance programs to make sure strong internal controls are in place to detect terrorism financing, money laundering, and high-risk transactions in order to mitigate potential legal and financial risks. Under Attorney General Bondi\u2019s \u201cSanctuary Jurisdiction Directives\u201d \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d will not receive federal grants administrated by the DOJ. \u201cSanctuary jurisdictions\u201d are defined to be \u201cstate or local jurisdictions that refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373, refuse to certify compliance with \u00a7 1373, or willfully fail to comply with other applicable federal immigration laws.\u201d[4] The memorandum calls for a review of grants subject to compliance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373(a), and funding agreements with non-governmental organizations that \u201csupport illegal aliens.\u201d The memorandum also encourages enforcement actions against jurisdictions that impede lawful immigration operations and that facilitate violations of immigration laws. [5] United States v. Kousisis, 82 F.4th 230 (3d Cir. 2023), cert. granted, 144 S. Ct. 2655 (2024). President Trump issued key executive orders aimed at Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI/DEIA) programs. For example, Executive Order 14173 mandates that federal contractors and grantees certify they do not operate DEI/DEIA programs that violate federal anti-discrimination laws and directs the Attorney General to develop a strategic enforcement plan targeting private sector DEI/DEIA programs believed to be unlawful. Executive Order 14151 requires federal agencies to terminate all \u201cequity-related\u201d contracts and grants introduced, as well as any \u201cillegal DEI\u201d activities within the federal government. [8] Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, 2024 WL 750795, at *i (Feb. 20, 2024). [1] On February 20, Secretary of State Marco Rubio designated eight organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), including Tren de Aragua, Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), C\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa, C\u00e1rtel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n, C\u00e1rtel del Noreste (formerly Los Zetas), La Nueva Familia Michoacana, C\u00e1rtel de Golfo (Gulf Cartel), and C\u00e1rteles Unidos as FTOs and SDGTs. These designations have resulting regulatory, civil, and criminal exposure consequences that corporations should be aware of. With 2025 underway, the ArentFox Schiff White Collar team highlights the US Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) new enforcement priorities and two cases pending before the US Supreme Court that could have sweeping implications for future white-collar fraud cases. In Thompson, the Supreme Court is set to answer \u201c[w]hether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014, which prohibits making a \u2018false statement\u2019 for the purpose of influencing certain financial institutions and federal agencies, also prohibits making a statement that is misleading but not false.\u201d[9] Attorney General Bondi also rescinded a Biden-era policy that allowed DOJ attorneys to utilize agency guidance documents in furtherance of enforcement actions. This change is aligned with a 2018 memorandum issued by Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand, that prohibited the DOJ from using guidance documents, or noncompliance with guidance documents, as the basis to initiate enforcement actions. Thompson argued that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 criminalizes only false statements, and that his statements were \u201cmisleading\u201d but not \u201cfalse.\u201d In an unexpected turn during oral argument on January 14, 2025, the Government agreed that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 criminalizes false statements, not misleading ones. The Government instead argued that the Thompson case is about the definition of \u201cfalse.\u201d While some Justices suggested this was beyond the scope of the question presented, others entertained the question and attempted to clarify the implications of what it means for a statement to be \u201cfalse,\u201d \u201cliterally false,\u201d \u201cfalse in context,\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014. Thompson advocated for an objective definition of falsity, while the government argued that falsity is context-specific and the circumstances surrounding the statement should be considered, including what information the listener was seeking and what impression the speaker intended on giving when making the alleged false statement. Immigration enforcement also promises to be a key aspect of DOJ\u2019s new priorities. Attorney General Bondi instructed the DOJ to use \u201call available criminal statutes\u201d to combat illegal immigration and to pursue charges related to criminal immigration-related violations when appropriate, consistent with \u201cthe core principle of pursuing the most serious, readily provable offenses.\u201d She further instructed US Attorneys\u2019 Offices to investigate any state and local actors who resist, obstruct, and otherwise fail to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests, and to assess potential prosecution, such as for obstructing federal functions. Each US Attorney\u2019s Office is now required, on a quarterly basis, to report the number of immigration-related cases referrals, pending investigations and prosecutions, convictions, sentencings, and removals, and are also required to disclose any declination of immigration-related offenses. In light of the government\u2019s concession that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 does not criminalize misleading statements, the Court\u2019s ruling on the question presented should be straightforward, but whether the Court goes further and decides that falsity is a context-specific assessment will be one that could have broad implications for false-statements prosecutions in the future. The Attorney General also identified human trafficking and smuggling as a priority for the DOJ, and elevated the Joint Task Force Alpha, created to enhance enforcement efforts in Central and South America, to the Office of the Attorney General. Joint Task Force Alpha will support investigations and prosecutions and will deploy to US Attorneys\u2019 Offices on the southern border. Charging Priorities and Removal of \u201cBureaucratic Roadblocks\u201d: Attorney General Bondi suggests it is prudent to deport, rather than prosecute, low-level investigative targets, and that it may not be worthwhile to seek foreign arrets and extraditions of targets eligible for safety-valve relief or minor role adjustments. For the 90 days following the directive, to enable aggressive prosecutions, the Attorney General suspended: (1) mandatory pre-indictment review for capital-eligible offenses for those alleged to be members or associates of cartels and TCOs; (2) approval requirements administered by NSD for the most serious terrorism charges and International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) charges; and (3) approval requirements administrated by the Violent Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division for filing racketeering charges and charges of violent crimes in aid of racketeering, targeting all cartels and TCOs. Within hours of her US Senate confirmation on February 5, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued 14 memoranda to all DOJ employees, shifting the DOJ\u2019s focus toward national security priorities and reallocating investigative resources and personnel. These memoranda largely implement directives set forth in executive orders issued in the first days of the Trump Administration. [2] On February 10, President Trump issued a Fact Sheet and an Executive Order, stating that \u201coverexpansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against American citizens and businesses \u2026 actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security.\u201d President Trump directed that, for the 180 days following the executive order, to restore American competitiveness and security, the Attorney General (1) cease initiation of FCPA investigations and enforcement actions, unless an exception is warranted; (2) review existing FCPA investigations and enforcement actions; and (3) issue updated guidelines and policies to restore American competitiveness and security. [4] The statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373(a), provides that state and local jurisdictions \u201cmay not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, [federal immigration officers] information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.\u201d Thompson was convicted with two counts of making false statements under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014. Between 2011 and 2014, Thompson took out three distinct loans from Washington Federal Bank for Savings, totaling $219,000. When the bank failed, a lending company sent Thompson an invoice for his total balance plus interest. In disputing the balance, Thompson stated that he had \u201cborrowed $110,000\u201d without mentioning the other amounts he had borrowed on the two additional loans.

Much like Goldman Sachs, Citi also based its decision on recession fears and weakening economic momentum. Nonetheless, the persisting concerns around trade tensions and the adverse impact of Trump's tariff plans on the US economy have been a persisting overhang for US equities.

That rating is based on 414 Buy, 85 Hold, and six Sell recommendations made in the last three months. The\u00a0average VOO price target\u00a0of $660.11 implies 29.46% upside from current levels. Stocks Currencies The agreement comes after seven hours of negotiations held on March 11 in Jedda, Saudi Arabia between high-level American and Ukrainian officials. The ceasefire deal also comes about 10 days after a public dust-up in the White House between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that upended the peace process and led America to withdraw its support to the country. It is not known if Russia will accept the proposed 30-day ceasefire and enter into peace talks with Ukraine following three years of war between the countries. In recent days, President Trump has threatened to ratchet up sanctions on Russia in an effort to get that country to entertain steps aimed at ending the war. Commodities The Government of Ukraine has reportedly agreed to an immediate 30-day ceasefire plan put forward by the U.S., if Russia also accepts the deal. \u201cToday, we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations to end this conflict in a way that\u2019s enduring and sustainable and accounts for their interests, their security, their ability to prosper as a nation,\u201d said Rubio, adding that, \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll take this offer now to the Russians, and we hope that they\u2019ll say yes, that they\u2019ll say yes to peace.\u201d \u201cUkraine is ready to start talking and stop shooting,\u201d said Secretary of State Marco Rubio at a news conference in Saudi Arabia where peace talks have been taking place.

Users with debt from smaller lenders using less advanced technology may find that Stretch doesn\u2019t fully integrate with these institutions. Similarly, those managing finances across multiple countries will likely find the app insufficient for their needs, as Stretch isn\u2019t designed to handle international financial complexities. But there\u2019s good news: Working toward financial goals, such as debt reduction or emergency fund building, typically correlates with increased confidence and security regardless of income level. Financial wellness creates stability that can improve overall quality of life. Stretch does have notable advantages, including its user-friendly interface, emphasis on progress over perfection and the ability to make payments directly through the app. Unlike some competitors, it offers a free version, albeit with significant limitations. In these cases, you might be better served by financial planning software with more advanced features, consulting with a financial advisor, or using free spreadsheet templates designed for budgeting. Financial stress affects more than your bank account. According to the American Psychological Association, 63 percent of Americans cite money as a significant source of stress. This stress can impact mental health, daily functioning and even physical wellbeing. In-app notifications: Through text or email, Stretch provides reminders about financial goals and payments. This financial literacy gap is reflected in Americans\u2019 saving habits. According to\u00a0Bankrate\u2019s 2024 Emergency Savings Report, 32 percent of consumers have less money in savings than they did a year ago, and 9 percent say they have no savings at all. The 2024 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index shows that financial literacy in the U.S. has remained at about 50 percent for eight years, with a 2 percent decline in the past two years. This knowledge gap often leads to financial decisions that can make progress difficult. The competitive budgeting app landscape includes alternatives like You Need a Budget (YNAB) and PocketGuard, which offer similar benefits at comparable price points. Do you need guidance to develop better financial habits but don\u2019t want to hire a financial advisor? Have basic budgeting apps failed to give you the structure and motivation you need? Is debt management (especially credit cards) a primary financial goal for you? Advertisement Debt management focus: Unlike some general budgeting apps, Stretch provides specific tools for monitoring and reducing debt, including credit score visibility. Before committing, you can take advantage of Stretch\u2019s free trial period to determine if its features align with your financial management style. This hands-on experience will reveal whether the app\u2019s interface, notification system and debt-tracking capabilities provide genuine value for your situation. If you\u2019re particularly focused on debt management and benefit from real-time feedback, Stretch\u2019s comprehensive dashboard might justify its $12.99 monthly subscription cost. The app can serve as a middle ground between basic free budgeting tools and more expensive financial advisory services. The $12.99 monthly fee for the Vision subscription may be counterproductive for budget-conscious users, especially since the free version only supports one credit card. Considering the average American has 3.84 credit cards, many users would need to upgrade to the paid plan for full functionality. Reputable budgeting apps typically employ secure encryption and follow privacy standards to protect financial data. Before signing up for any financial service, verify its security features and privacy policy. The app provides tools to help users understand their financial situation, plan for the future and work toward personal financial goals. It approaches financial management by breaking down complex concepts into more manageable steps and providing actionable insights.

Real-time insights: Get up-to-date notifications on your spending and savings so you can adjust in the moment. Centralized dashboard: The Vision subscription allows users to link banking accounts, credit cards and various debts including student loans, car loans and mortgages. Does Stretch charge fees for its features? Financial marketplace: Users can explore financial products from selected institutions, including credit cards, loans, bank accounts and more. Stretch aims to differentiate itself from standard budgeting apps by offering more comprehensive tools for financial management. While budgeting apps are plentiful, Stretch offers several useful features: AOL In behavioral economics, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cnudging\u201d \u2014 small, thoughtful prompts that help us make better decisions without being intrusive. Budgeting apps often claim to be that nudge, but not all of them deliver. Some simply log your spending after the fact, while others try to guide you toward smarter money habits in real time. Customized goal setting: Define and track goals like saving for an emergency fund, staying within a budget or paying off debt. Stretch offers these key features: Stretch Financial Wellness (simply known as \u201cStretch\u201d) aims to take financial management further by focusing on where your money can take you rather than just showing how you spend it. Let\u2019s examine Stretch\u2019s features, benefits and limitations to help you determine if it\u2019s right for your financial goals. Financial education: Learn what you need to know with easy-to-understand info designed to boost your financial confidence and knowledge. Stretch Financial Wellness is an app designed to help users manage their finances with a focus on debt management, real-time insights and guidance for making financial progress. Can Stretch help pay off credit card debt? For premium support please call: Financial wellness extends beyond money management \u2014 it\u2019s about having the freedom to make choices that improve your quality of life without constant financial worry. Whether handling unexpected expenses or saving for long-term goals, financial wellness provides greater control over your money and increased peace of mind. Though marketed as a comprehensive financial wellness tool, Stretch may not adequately serve those with complex financial situations due to its limited personalization and absence of human advisor support. If you answered yes to most of these questions, Stretch could be beneficial. However, consider alternative solutions if you have complex financial circumstances requiring personalized advice, manage finances across international borders, are already comfortable using spreadsheets or other low-cost alternatives, or find that the subscription cost doesn\u2019t fit your budget. Stretch includes features for tracking debt, monitoring credit scores and creating payment plans that may help with credit card debt management. Choosing the right budgeting app starts with understanding your financial needs and habits. To determine if Stretch is a fit for you, consider these questions: Would real-time spending insights and reminders help you make better financial decisions? That said, Stretch isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution for financial planning or budgeting. While it offers helpful features, there are some limitations to consider. Stretch offers a 7-day free trial, after which the Vision subscription costs $9.99 monthly for the first three months with promotional code SAVE3FOR3.

The European tariffs apply to industrial-grade steel and aluminum, other steel and aluminum products, and derivative commercial products such as machinery parts. Unlike Mexico, Canada and China, Europe had not been hit by Trump\u2019s tariffs until now. European Commission data shows that the overall EU / U.S. trade in goods and services in 2023 totaled $1.68 trillion. Indices Machinery and vehicles are the biggest European exports to the U.S., followed by chemicals and pharmaceutical products. Stocks The EU has hit back with its own counter measures, saying the European bloc needs to protect domestic consumers and businesses. Trump confirmed 25% duties on all steel and aluminum imports, which apply to not only Europe but to Canada and Australia as well. Currencies The European Union (EU) has retaliated against U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum imports from the continent. Commodities The EU\u2019s approach will see previously suspended tariffs re-imposed on eight billion euros of U.S. imports, and a slew of new countermeasures on 18 billion euros of goods in a move the EU leadership described as \u201cstrong but proportionate\u201d in a news release. However, Trump backed down on an earlier threat to impose tariffs of up to 50% on metals from Canada. The European Union has responded quickly, imposing counter-tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28.33 billion) worth of American goods starting in April.", "https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-and-nasdaq-on-course-for-higher-open-as-cpi-inflation-data-looms/card/dow-s-relief-rally-quickly-fades-here-are-some-key-stocks-dragging-it-down--Qd91pe0w9QnZlCpkG3Km": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/why-the-invesco-qqq-etf-tech-bloodbath-is-a-buying-opportunity-1034469160": " It goes without saying that market selloffs never feel particularly good for investors. The ongoing slide in tech stocks continues, with the Nasdaq index down 12% from its all-time high. However, newer investors and those investing in the long term can have a good opportunity to add great names to their portfolios at discounted prices, which benefits them in the long run.\u00a0One great example during the current tech sell-off is the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF, now down 12.9% from its all-time high and 7.5% lower year-to-date. Moreover, Invesco\u2019s ETF pays dividends and offers a modest 0.6% dividend yield, albeit below the sector average of 1.2%. Most recent reported figures indicate that the QQQ ETF pays $0.83 in dividends per share. As an added bonus for long-term investors and those just starting a position now, many of these names are considerably cheaper and trading at lower prices than just a few weeks ago. For example, Alphabet (GOOGL) trades in correction territory, down 19.9% from its 52-week high, and trades at a below-market multiple of just 18.5x forward earnings estimates. Similarly, while skeptics have questioned Nvidia\u2019s expensive valuation over the past few years, the stock is now down 30% from its 52-week highs and trades at an incredibly reasonable valuation of just 23.8x forward earnings estimates. Currencies QQQ earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 89 Buys, 13 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst QQQ price target of $605.31 implies a 28.3% upside potential from current levels over the next twelve months. QQQ\u2019s top 10 holdings feature some of the market\u2019s biggest and best-known names, whether magnificent-7 stocks like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) or other powerhouses like Costco (COST) and Netflix (NFLX). These blue-chip growth stocks represent many of the world\u2019s best and most innovative companies, making them an attractive proposition for long-term shareholders. Market selloffs are never fun in the short term. But newer investors and investors with a long-term time horizon can be a blessing in disguise, as they offer a chance to add strong investments like QQQ to their portfolios at significantly lower price points. Many investors and individuals on the sidelines have been wishing they had bought these stocks earlier or when they were cheaper, so the present situation seems like a good chance to do just that. QQQ maintains an expense ratio of 0.20%, meaning an investor will pay $20 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually, which isn\u2019t bad, especially given QQQ\u2019s strong performance. While this is a bit more expensive than some broad-market ETFs, it\u2019s well below the average expense ratio for all ETFs, which is 0.57%, according to State Street. Assuming that the ETF returns 5% per year going forward, the investor putting $10,000 into QQQ would pay $113 in fees over five years and $255 in costs over a 10-year time horizon. Following the sharp decline, I\u2019m bullish on the Nasdaq-tracking ETF based on its stellar long-term track record, diversified portfolio of blue-chip growth stocks, and reasonable expense ratio. As an added bonus, while things have been painful in the short term, Wall St. analysts forecast a potential upside of almost 30% for QQQ over the next 12 months. QQQ currently holds 101 stocks, giving fund participants instant diversification into a broad group of the most extensive non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Its top 10 holdings make up just under 50% of its assets. Let\u2019s also look at QQQ\u2019s performance from a cumulative perspective to illustrate its appeal to long-term investors. As of February 28, QQQ generated a cumulative three-year return of 49.5%, meaning an investor who put $10,000 into the fund three years ago would have $14,950 three years later. Going out even further, the results are even more pronounced. QQQ\u2019s five-year cumulative return stands at an even more impressive 155%, so an investor putting $10,000 into QQQ five years ago would have an investment worth $25,497 five years later. On a ten-year horizon, QQQ\u2019s phenomenal cumulative return of 407.4% means that an investor putting $10,000 into QQQ 10 years ago would have a position worth over $50,000 today. Stocks I remain firmly bullish on QQQ based on its exemplary performance over the years, its portfolio of blue-chip growth stocks, and its moderate expense ratio. While the market could still head lower from here in the short term, investors who look past short-term pain and take advantage of fearful sellers will be thankful in the long term. Commodities Disclosure With over $300 billion in assets under management, QQQ is today\u2019s fifth-largest ETF in the stock market. The fund, launched in 1999, tracks the Nasdaq-100 (NDX) index, providing investors access to the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. Because of the Nasdaq-100\u2019s tech\u2014and growth-centric nature, the fund skews towards large-cap growth and tech stocks, although this isn\u2019t its explicit strategy. At last month\u2019s close, QQQ reported a three-year annualized return of 14.4%. Moreover, the fund has posted a stellar five-year annualized return of 20.6% and an impeccable 10-year annualized return of 17.6%. These remarkable returns mean that it has beaten the broader market over each of these time frames \u2014 for comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 (SPX), posted strong annualized returns of 12.4% over the past three years, 16.6% over the past five years, and 12.8% over the past 10 years. These are strong returns but still trail those of QQQ over each time horizon. Indices When looking at QQQ\u2019s long-term track record, it\u2019s easy to see why both retail and institutional investors love this fund. Over the past year, Invesco QQQ has delivered 443% greater returns than the S&P 500. Therefore, despite QQQ being down 10% this month, its past performance demonstrates that any sell-offs tend to be decent buying opportunities, allowing investors to gain exposure to a proven fund with stable returns at lower prices. While past performance does not guarantee future results, QQQ has established itself as a long-term winner and an investment that has consistently beaten the broader market and generated significant wealth for its investors over a long time horizon. That makes it easy to see why the current weakness over the past month should be considered a buying opportunity for long-term investors.", "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/news/kansas-city-chiefs-make-patrick-mahomes-contract-decision-after-free-agent-news/b6db95986bbb8453193ded67": "New Orleans Saints Entertainment  LA Clippers Stadium Guides Apple TV Fashion Miami Dolphins NHL Green Bay Packers Trending Cleveland Browns MMA Philadelphia Eagles Best Streaming Services Golf New York Knicks Memphis Grizzlies Best VPN Services Milwaukee Bucks Polls Chicago Bulls Philadelphia 76ers Minnesota Timberwolves NFL WWE Dallas Mavericks High School Las Vegas Raiders Buffalo Bills Standings MLB Indiana Pacers Dallas Cowboys Jacksonville Jaguars Dylan Fine Chris Jones\u2019 decision to adjust his contract showcases the positive relationship the star defensive tackle has developed with the franchise.

More to bring you now from a Russian missile attack yesterday on the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukraine's foreign minister has described the strike as an attack on global food security and maritime safety. The US president also says \"we have people going to Russia right now\" - following reports his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Moscow this week. He says the US has received \"some positive messages\" after its proposal of a ceasefire at talks with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia yesterday. Trump's top diplomat Marco Rubio has urged Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day ceasefire - after the Kremlin said it was studying the proposal but would not agree to anything until it had heard from the US.

Videos geolocated by Sky News show Russian forces swiftly advancing on the key town of Sudzha on its southern border. As we've been reporting this morning, US-Ukraine talks have brought about a proposal for a temporary ceasefire in the war, and it's now in Russia's hands. \"But the incentive for the Ukrainians is greater than the incentive for the Russians.\" He also added the vessel was due to deliver wheat to Algeria. He says \"it is clear\" Volodymyr Zelenskyy is willing to make peace, and repeated Marco Rubio's statement that the ball is now in Russia's court. \"Hopefully we can get a ceasefire,\" he tells reporters, adding \"it is up to Russia now\". \"If they do not pursue the ceasefire with the same vigour as Ukraine, there will be hell to pay,\" he adds. Sudzha is situated just north of the border to Ukraine in Kursk and had a pre-invasion population of more than 5,000 people.

Since the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire was raised in talks with Ukrainian officials yesterday, the big question on the lips of analysts has been whether Russia would accept the plans. They are holding virtual discussions with Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov over aid for his country, with a follow-up meeting to be held on building European defence capabilities. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"We do not take this decision lightly, but we have always made clear to Russia that if they escalate, we will take reciprocal action. The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength. But both sides \"could do with a rest\" and \"both sides would use any time... to reorganise themselves and restock as far as they can\". \"Zelenskyy has passed the test of wanting peace. It is now up to Putin to show his cards,\" Graham says. Now, in a matter of days, Russian forces have reclaimed the centre of the town. More now on the situation in Kursk - which we've been reporting on throughout the day. On 11 March, footage showed large groups of Ukrainian troops pulling back from the centre of Sudzha on foot.

'The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength' Ukraine took control of Sudzha during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 in just under two weeks. Initially named as Trump's Middle East envoy shortly after the US election, Steve Witkoff has since been involved in negotiations with Russia about ending the war in Ukraine.

We are not averse to investing in mid and small cap stocks. However, our investment process is focused on quality filters such as earnings growth, price-to-earning multiples, and return on capital.Many of the mid cap companies that have performed well in the past couple of years did not meet our strict quality criteria when they were ready to be bought. By the time they matched our filters, their valuations had already run up significantly.Also in a portfolio management context, we need to consider the liquidity of the portfolio and the ability to manage client redemptions. Small and mid cap stocks can be less liquid, which poses challenges in this regard.While we are not fundamentally opposed to mid and small cap stocks, our focus on quality and liquidity management led us to miss out on some of the outsized returns in these segments of the market.What is the market-cap distribution of your portfolio?Our portfolio is primarily focused on large cap companies.

Our experience has shown that these tend to lead to poor performance. The rationale behind this is that no one can accurately predict market movements, and trying to time the market through cash calls often backfires.We believe a PMS manager's role is to remain invested and generate returns for clients over the long term. Cash calls disrupt this core objective and can significantly impact the portfolio's performance.We prefer to manage risk through other instruments and techniques, such as diversification, position sizing, and selective hedging if required. But the fundamental approach is to remain invested and ride out market cycles rather than trying to time the market.Do you avoid multinationals in your portfolio?We don\u2019t entirely avoid MNCs in our portfolios.

By synthesizing these dimensions, the ONS method provides a holistic view of SKU performance that aligns commercial, operational and financial priorities into one common language. 3. SKU Ranking And Prioritization: Rank the SKUs based on their ONS to determine a prioritized list. Apply the Pareto principle (selecting the top 80% contributing SKUs) to form a must-stock list that drives focused sales and marketing efforts. Sales figures alone can be misleading as an SKU. For example, high sales may have low profitability or slow movement, which leads to inventory inefficiencies. In some instances, high-sales SKUs need significant trade promotions, discounts or retailer incentives, which reduces net profitability despite strong top-line figures. On the other hand, a lower-sales SKU may have high margins and contribute significantly to strategic growth. 4. Integrate Qualitative Adjustments: Validate the data-driven rankings with qualitative insights from market trends, shopper feedback and strategic considerations. Adjust as necessary to account for factors like new product launches, phase-outs or strategic marketing investments. ByAziz Jafri \u2022 Multi-Dimensional Analysis: Because the ONS framework gives revenue, velocity and profitability their own weights, it empowers leaders to make decisions that balance short-term gains with long-term strategic objectives. For example, an SKU with high sales may actually be dragging down overall profitability or market momentum, necessitating a more nuanced evaluation. With the ONS, that SKU would receive a lower score, alerting leaders that it should have a lower ranking in prioritization. 1. Data Collection: Gather current, accurate data on each SKU\u2019s annual sales contribution (in dollar terms), sales velocity (as dollars per million ACV, converted into a percentage) and gross margin. In an era where data-driven decision making is a critical competitive differentiator, adopting the ONS method equips managers with a strategic edge that goes beyond traditional practices. To solve this issue, I developed the One Number Score (ONS) method, which combines sales contribution, sales velocity and profitability into a single, actionable metric. This unified score reveals a more accurate picture of each product\u2019s strategic value, so it can help leaders in informed, agile decision making during critical retailer line reviews. For example, I helped a leading vitamins brand adopt an ONS-based ranking, and it completely changed how the portfolio was prioritized. Previously, gummy vitamins dominated the brand\u2019s focus due to the product\u2019s high sales, but the ONS analysis uncovered the superior profitability and faster velocity of effervescent tablets. So these products were moved up the priority list and given more investment and shelf space. As a result, overall profitability improved, and the brand learned to prioritize faster-turning products so its shelf space was more efficient and productive. Recently, I\u2019m seeing this sentiment being echoed in industry forums, cross-functional planning sessions and discussions with peers across consumer product categories. Teams are increasingly recognizing that focusing solely on sales leads to misaligned priorities and reactive decision making. Without integrating multiple dimensions, businesses risk prioritizing SKUs that generate revenue but fail to maximize long-term value. Based on my experience in SKU prioritization processes across sales, supply chain and category management functions, I\u2019ve come to realize that consumer product companies need to shift from a narrow reliance on raw sales figures and adopt a more holistic, data-driven approach. Oftentimes, having such a limited focus creates blind spots\u2014particularly around profitability, operational complexity and strategic fit. The ONS method is a structured framework designed to help consumer product companies make more balanced, data-driven decisions when managing and prioritizing SKUs. It calculates a composite score based on three critical dimensions: revenue (sales performance), velocity (how quickly a product turns at the shelf) and profitability (the gross margin of the SKU). , Forbes Councils Member. \u2022 Balanced Weighting: Assigning 70% weight to sales contribution while allocating the remaining 30% equally to sales velocity and profitability is a deliberate choice that challenges the default focus on revenue alone. This ensures every decision is informed by both quantitative performance and market dynamics. 2. Weighing And Calculation: Multiply each metric by its assigned weight, then add the results to generate a composite score for every SKU. Let\u2019s say an SKU\u2019s sales contribution is 20%, velocity contribution is 10% and gross margin is 60%. By multiplying the sales contribution by its 70% weight, you get 0.14. The velocity contribution multiplied by its 15% weight is 0.015, and the gross margin multiplied by its 15% weight is 0.09. Adding these scores together, the final ONS is 0.245. With this framework, leaders can identify which SKUs truly drive strategic growth, enabling them to focus on the products that yield both immediate revenue and sustainable market advantages. They can prepare more compelling and precise retailer line reviews, ensuring discussions are grounded in data and aligned with strategic priorities. With clearer insights into each SKU\u2019s performance, leaders can better allocate marketing, sales and inventory resources, thus reducing waste and optimizing performance. Aziz Jafri is an accomplished CPG sales professional and trade marketing expert with 12+ years of experience in leading MNCs. \u2022 Enhanced Clarity: A single composite score simplifies the evaluation process, reducing complexity in large SKU portfolios and enabling clearer communication across sales, marketing and supply chain teams. The ONS method involves a clear, structured approach that blends quantitative analysis with qualitative business insight. By following these steps, you can embed this framework into your regular product review and SKU prioritization processes. By following the ONS methodology, leaders can drive more strategic, data-informed decisions. This approach simplifies complex SKU portfolios and ensures every product is evaluated in a manner that balances revenue with long-term strategic value. As such, leaders are empowered to make strong moves in a data-driven business landscape. Forbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives.

He says \"it is clear\" Volodymyr Zelenskyy is willing to make peace, and repeated Marco Rubio's statement that the ball is now in Russia's court. \"Hopefully we can get a ceasefire,\" he tells reporters, adding \"it is up to Russia now\". \"If they do not pursue the ceasefire with the same vigour as Ukraine, there will be hell to pay,\" he adds. Sudzha is situated just north of the border to Ukraine in Kursk and had a pre-invasion population of more than 5,000 people. It says it is clear that Russia is trying to drive the British embassy in Moscow towards closure, and adds it is revoking accreditation for a Russian diplomat and diplomatic spouse. \"The Russians would rather carry on, the Ukrainians would rather get a pause,\" Clarke says.

Security and defence analyst Michael Clarke\u00a0has been answering your questions on the war in Ukraine in the past half hour. Since the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire was raised in talks with Ukrainian officials yesterday, the big question on the lips of analysts has been whether Russia would accept the plans. They are holding virtual discussions with Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov over aid for his country, with a follow-up meeting to be held on building European defence capabilities. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"We do not take this decision lightly, but we have always made clear to Russia that if they escalate, we will take reciprocal action. The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength. But both sides \"could do with a rest\" and \"both sides would use any time... to reorganise themselves and restock as far as they can\". \"Zelenskyy has passed the test of wanting peace. It is now up to Putin to show his cards,\" Graham says. Now, in a matter of days, Russian forces have reclaimed the centre of the town. More now on the situation in Kursk - which we've been reporting on throughout the day. On 11 March, footage showed large groups of Ukrainian troops pulling back from the centre of Sudzha on foot.

'The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength' Ukraine took control of Sudzha during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 in just under two weeks. Initially named as Trump's Middle East envoy shortly after the US election, Steve Witkoff has since been involved in negotiations with Russia about ending the war in Ukraine. In short - a ceasefire now is \"of more tactical use to the Ukrainians than it is to the Russians\", he says.

Any further action taken by Russia will be considered an escalation and responded to accordingly.\" But Trump also had a warning for Russia, saying \"there are things you could do in a financial sense that would be very bad for Russia\". While sitting in front of the cameras in the Oval Office, Donald Trump said \"we have people going to Russia right now\" - but only one man has been trusted to head up Donald Trump's envoy to Moscow, and he's far from the typical diplomat.", "https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/03/44276395/charlie-munger-warned-about-blackrocks-power-we-have-a-new-bunch-of-emperors-and-larry-fink-shouldnt-rule-the-world": "During shareholder Q&A at the Daily Journal Corporation DJCO shareholders meeting in 2022, Munger was asked about the impact of passive investing on stock valuations.

While employing more Americans in industries like autos is a noteworthy objective (along with reducing the flow of fentanyl which is another stated reason for the tariff threat), there also needs to be a realization that building a factory to make the cars takes years along with tens of millions of dollars.

U.S. companies can benefit from the relative \"cheapness\" of European assets. European companies are undervalued, despite having similar profitability prospects to their American counterparts. This offers U.S. investors a chance to acquire European assets at a discount. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar, coupled with access to U.S. capital markets, facilitates cross-border transactions, making European assets even more appealing for acquisition. The Economic and Financial Gap Between the United States and Europe: Will It Persist or Narrow? The economic and financial gap between the United States and Europe, as highlighted by the recent growth figures and disparities in GDP per capita, appears to be widening and could persist or even deepen in the near future. While the U.S. economy continues to demonstrate surprising resilience, with projected growth between 2.5% and 3% in 2025, Europe's growth is expected to remain much lower, between 0.5% and 1%.

While Europe remains attractive for American investors seeking undervalued assets, the divergence creates long-term challenges for European companies looking to compete with the U.S. The next few years may see more European companies being acquired by U.S. firms, further cementing the financial and economic gap. On the flip side, the economic divergence also presents opportunities for European companies, particularly when looking to expand into the U.S. market: European Start-ups: For start-ups, the U.S. remains an attractive destination for growth.

What's going on there? KS: Yeah, Bridgette, thanks for bringing up this point because it's really interesting. Everything we've talked about to date about the Act sort of hangs together, right? There are going to be changes to those notice of material change submissions. There's going to be additional authority for market oversight and these financial assessments. But also included in this bill was a really interesting change to the Massachusetts False Claims Act that I think a lot of the country is watching right now. Massachusetts, like a lot of states, has its own sort of mini False Claims Act that's very similar to the federal False Claims Act. The change that was made by this latest legislation is that entities with an ownership or investment interest in an entity that violates the Massachusetts FCA can potentially have direct liability for an FCA violation. BK: For sure, and I'm really excited to talk about that today. My understanding is that this law was passed after almost five months in conference committee and disagreeing votes from the House and the Senate. And now it's here, after being long-awaited, that whole long process. And it's poised to substantially broaden the application of one of the oldest state health care market review laws in the country. CP: I'm Cassie Paolillo. I'm Of Counsel at Mintz. I also work on health care transactions and advise clients on a range of regulatory issues with a particular focus on Massachusetts-specific issues. I've had a lot of experience dealing with our existing health care transaction review laws in Massachusetts and will continue to do so once this new law goes into effect. BK: Yes, me too, Cassie. Why don't we start with a quick introduction, just share a little bit with our listeners about yourselves and your practice and how this law influences that. Deb, do you want to kick us off? CP: Our understanding is that the HPC does plan to issue guidance ahead of the April 8 effective date with more comprehensive regulations to follow. We're hopeful that there will be more guidance and that these very broad definitions will be narrowed somewhat, which I think is going to be really important because of the breadth here and really the uncertainty that's going to follow in terms of what information is going to need to be provided in connection with these notices. CP: That is correct, yes. At this point, based on the reading of the statute, providers of purely administrative services, like billing and collection vendors, could trip that definition of a management services organization, as well as equity owners that are multiple layers up from the transaction could be potentially included in the filing. CP: I do want to note though that while the Act does expand the number of transactions that will be subject to the notice requirement, it does not actually change the materiality threshold for which transactions will trigger the more in-depth cost and market impact review. So, while certainly more transactions will have to file the notice, we don't anticipate a significant increase in the number of CMIRs that will be ordered by the HPC. The other piece that I know we've had clients have some concerns about is that CHIA in Massachusetts is responsible for receiving a lot of annual reports from provider organizations on essentially their financial information and information about their operations. And the Act is going to expand what CHIA can ask for in some pretty significant ways. And here we're in a little bit of a wait-and-see to see what CHIA promulgates for new regulations because we don't yet have information on exactly what they're going to require. My guess using a crystal ball is they're going to start with the larger providers. They're going to start with the hospitals and the health systems. And then it may be a while before we see significantly increased reporting from other provider types. Have questions or want to connect with the team? Reach out to us at [email\u00a0protected]. KS: That's correct. Historically, only a portion of the operations of HPC and CHIA have been funded out of the general fund of the Commonwealth. And a portion of HPC and CHIA's operating budgets have always come from certain players, certain regulated entities in the health care industry. But what this Act changes is the breakdown of how that funding works and also the market players who are going to be subject to those financial assessments. Back to Top Explore 2025 Readers' Choice Awards In particular, I think the addition of changes in ownership or control that involve a significant equity investor is going to represent a substantial expansion of HPC's authority because of how broadly significant an equity investor has been defined under the new law. Specifically, it's defined as any private equity company with a financial interest in a provider, provider organization, or management services organization, or an investor group of investors or other entity with direct or indirect equity ownership totaling more than 10 % of a provider, provider organization or MSO. BK: It\u2019s fascinating. So, tell me a little bit about management services organizations and private equity companies. They're both broadly defined, right? And this idea of filing the notice of material change. It goes live on April 8, no matter what, even absent additional guidance. Is that right? The Act gives CHIA the authority to require certain provider organizations to file not only their own financial statements but also audited financial statements of their parent organizations, their significant equity investors, health care REITs, and MSOs that can also extend to out-of-state operations of those parent organizations. So not just financials related to sort of within the Commonwealth operations, but nationwide. Deb, Cassie, and Kate, thank you so much for sharing your expertise on this new law. Listeners, thank you for joining us for this episode of Health Law Diagnosed . The reason that this change is important is because it not only will impact the timeline and other considerations around planning for these transactions, because there is an advance notice requirement, but it also is going to significantly expand the amount of information that certain investors are going to have to disclose to the state. Now, most of the information disclosed will be exempt from public records laws so it won't be published on the HPC's website, but it still represents an expansion in the amount of information that's going to have to be disclosed in connection with these transactions and potentially following the transactions. BK: Wow, Cassie, that's really broad. Additionally, the Attorney General's Office has a broader scope based on these newly regulated actors in terms of what that office can do to obtain information about costs. The Act expands the Attorney General's Office's authority to allow it to obtain information from significant equity investors, REITs, and MSOs related to notices of material change or reports that are made to CHIA. Certainly, there is an expanded authority here for the Attorney General's Office without needing to have launched a formal investigation. They can seek more information from these entities. BK: Deb, we\u2019re so happy to have you here today. Thank you. Cassie, want to give us a quick introduction? BK: Yes, I think that sounds great. So, listeners, please stay tuned. Maybe we can get that one out to you all in a couple of weeks. Deborah Daccord (DB): You're welcome. Happy to be here. As you alluded to at the beginning, Massachusetts is just one of at least 35 states that require health care providers, hospitals, physician groups, various types of ambulatory care providers, and the firms that invest in or manage those providers to notify state agencies of proposed transactions. But Massachusetts was the first to create, as we indicated over 12 years ago, an independent state agency, the HPC, to administer the process and conduct a cost and market impact review, or CMIR, when necessary. Other states have now started following along in Massachusetts' shoes, such as California. In addition to the existing transaction types that have been subject to review under the existing law, the statutory definition of material change now includes significant expansions in a provider or provider organization\u2019s capacity, transactions involving a significant equity investor, which results in a change of ownership or control of a provider or provider organizations, and real estate sale leasebacks and similar arrangements, and any conversion of a provider or provider organization from a nonprofit entity to a for-profit entity. In the latest episode of Health Law Diagnosed, host Bridgette Keller discusses the new Massachusetts Health Care Market Review Law and what this means for health care providers, investors, and other key stakeholders. She is joined by Member Deborah Daccord, Of Counsel, Cassie Paolillo, and Of Counsel Kate Stewart, who share their insights on the law\u2019s far-reaching implications, including: BK: Yeah, absolutely. And it's really interesting to think of how it parallels the overpayment rule, right? And with the same 60-day timing requirement. KS: Yeah, it's definitely a big change. One other change that the law makes that I think a lot of industry players maybe aren't yet aware of is the potential that they could be subject to financial assessments to help fund the operations of the HPC and CHIA.

Cassie Paolillo (CP): Looking forward to talking about this exciting new law. DD: Thank you, Bridgette. I'm Deb Daccord. I'm based in the firm's Miami and Boston offices with almost 30 years of experience doing nothing but health industry transactions. So, for me and my practice, this new law will have a significant impact on my clients who are doing business in Massachusetts and elsewhere. Notably, the Act also increases the penalties for entities that fail to timely comply with their CHIA reporting obligations. So everybody should be aware that those penalties are going to go up. I think one thing we've had some clients ask about proactively, is there anything they need to be doing right now? Like is there a report coming up that they need to be making? But certainly, those of us who work in the transactional space and work with the investor community are watching this carefully. I think we're also watching to see if other states in the nation follow suit to update their own State False Claims Act. In each case, their authority to require financial, structural, and operational information from a wide variety of health care providers and those seeking to provide them with investment, management, and other services. What this means practically is that the scope of these agencies' authority now applies well beyond the traditional health care providers that we've been working for as long as the predecessor law has been in place to now include significant equity investors, providers of administrative and management services, you can refer to those as MSOs, real estate investment trusts or REITs, pharmaceutical manufacturing companies, pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs, and commercial, governmental, and self-insured payers. The goals of this act were really to increase financial transparency and the Commonwealth's ability to examine both the anticipated and the long-term impact of proposed health care transactions. I think it's going to be a really great discussion today. I'm wondering, Deb, would you mind starting us off with an overview of the new law and what it really will do? BK: Very interesting. I think you all were telling me too that there are some new provisions regarding additional authorities for the HPC and other agencies in Massachusetts to monitor the health care market. So, Kate, you and I were talking a little bit about this. What are the key takeaways from this portion of the act? The first of those is annually here in Massachusetts, we wait as health care lawyers, health care policy wonks for the HPC's annual cost trends hearing and then their cost trends report. Going forward, there's going to be a significant shift in the breadth and scope of those cost trends hearings and reports. For the first time, it's going to include costs, prices, and cost trends for pharmaceutical manufacturing companies and PBMs, which is obviously a very new aspect for this HPC to be looking at. I tuned into a recent HPC webinar where one of the things that they were talking about was just how complicated it is to understand the drug supply chain, the way that wholesalers, manufacturers, PBMs, and end users access pharmaceuticals and all of the ways that costs flow through that chain. I think this is going to be a really interesting space to watch in this coming year and in subsequent years to see how HPC dives into the sort of cost pressures that are coming from the pharmaceutical sector specifically. HPC is also going to be required to call as witnesses for those cost trends hearings representatives from the PBM industry, representatives from the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, and individuals representing significant equity investors, health care REITs, or MSOs. So, it'll be really fascinating to watch sort of how HPC structures the next round of these reports and these hearings. Refine your interests \u00bb BK: That part was fascinating to me, and I had dug into that on understanding the PBM law and I had to read it a few times to make sure I was understanding it correctly. But really, they were going to be assessing the different types of entities, a portion of the total operating budget, right Kate? So, the Act also imposes certain requirements on some other departments that previously weren't part of it and that's the Department of Public Health or DPH, relating to office-based surgical, urgent care centers, and acute care hospitals that lease from health care REITs. A significant piece of this new law is that it now puts in place prohibitions for acute care hospitals, for example, to even lease their main campus from REITs. That's a big change. BK: Do you think the HPC will issue any guidance or provide any details about what a financial interest means or is everybody just taking this to mean, okay, it's anything at this point? DD: Yeah, absolutely. And like you, I'm very excited to see where this law goes because you're right. The Act, which changes an existing law, goes into effect April 8 and expands the authority of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Center for Health Information and Analysis, which we affectionately refer to as CHIA, and the Health Policy Commission or HPC. BK: Absolutely. How long do you think all of this will take? Now with this greater and more significant scrutiny, will transactions be delayed from closing? Bridgette, one thing your clients might be really interested in is that there are actually assessments here against pharmaceutical manufacturing companies and PBMs. They're smaller in terms of the overall bucket than the assessment against the providers. But it's certainly a brave new world for these entities that had not previously been subject to this type of oversight in the Commonwealth and this type of financial assessment. KS: Yeah, absolutely, Bridgette. It's an interesting tie to the overpayment rule on the federal side. BK: Yes, Kate, absolutely. That's why I spent so much time digging into the law to be sure I was reading it correctly because we don't typically see these types of financial assessments in those regulatory schemes in the states. Copyright \u00a9  JD Supra, LLC DD: I do. I think it would be a great idea because Massachusetts is just one of many states that have recently expanded or are proposing to expand their health care transaction review laws. And there are a number of states that since January have similar laws that are pending, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Mexico, New York, Texas, and Washington. It would be a great idea for us to be able to take a deeper dive into, say, California and some of these other laws in part two of this podcast. I will note that the definitions do include carve-outs for venture capital firms that are exclusively funding startups or other early-stage businesses. So that will be helpful for some investors in this space. CP: Thanks, Bridgette. I think from my perspective, one of the biggest changes that's going to have a pretty far-reaching effect on health care transactions across the board is the expansion of the Health Policy Commission's material change process, which is historically focused on transactions between providers, provider organizations, and payers. But as Deb mentioned, it's now being expanded to apply to other players in this space including significant equity investors and providers or provider organizations, REITs, management services organizations, and other administrative providers. In addition, the Act\u2019s changes to the DPH\u2019s oversight and regulatory authority, and I can't emphasize this enough, includes requiring the DPH to establish regulations and licensing standards for services that previously were never licensed before such as office-based surgery and urgent care centers, and importantly prohibits the DPH from issuing a license to an acute care hospital if its main campus will be leased from a REIT. That's a seachange. We understand why. This is largely in response to the Steward Health bankruptcy, but it's a big deal and demonstrates that the primary focus of the Act, increasing scrutiny of the Massachusetts health care market, is far-reaching. BK: Wow, thank you so much, Cassie. That's a detailed explanation and it's really helpful for our listeners to get an idea of what these changes mean and what could happen as they're thinking about potential transactions in the Massachusetts health care market. Kate Stewart (KS): Thanks for having us, Bridgette. BK: Wow, Deb, that's incredible. And it's clear that the impact of the changes that the Act is putting forward is going to be broad and far-reaching, especially given the number of states who may follow suit as they have been across the country. I'd love to dig into some of the major takeaways for existing and future players in the Massachusetts health care market. So, Cassie, let me pose this one over to you. What would you highlight as a key takeaway from the law? So historically, there were financial assessments to help fund HPC and CHIA levied against hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. There had historically been assessments against payers as well, although that was taken out through separate legislation. But now that there's this additional market oversight for other actors in the industry, that financial assessment is actually much broader. Entities like clinical laboratories, imaging facilities, and other registered provider organizations who register with CHIA all need to be carefully looking at this legislation to see if they are going to be subject to a financial assessment so that they don't have a surprise when those come out. We did a blog post on this actually. I'm not going to get too deep into the methodology on the podcast here, but we do have a summary and a table of that financial assessment that's going to be borne by each of those provider types and how that assessment is calculated. KS: This really mirrors what Cassie was talking about, about the expanded number and types of entities that are going to need to make notice of material change filings. So similarly, this Act gives the Attorney General's Office, the HPC, and CHIA some additional authority that they didn't previously have to help monitor broad-based health care cost trends. California even calls it a CMIR review, taking Massachusetts nomenclature into its own. But now, based on more than a decade of experience reviewing these health care transactions and monitoring their aftermath, specifically, the Steward Healthcare bankruptcy in particular, the Massachusetts legislature and governor have expanded the scope and authority of these agencies, the HPC, CHIA, the AG's office, to be among the most comprehensive in the nation. KS: It\u2019s certainly interesting and it'll be interesting to watch if those industries try to bring any sort of challenge to this financial assessment. It\u2019s worth taking a look at the methodology for how it's going to be calculated. \u00a9Mintz - Health Care Viewpoints DD: Yes, actually there are. Of course, this is just one process among many that health care providers need to go through when they're either establishing new health care services or changing ownership, and that includes licensing and certificate or determination of need processes. The latter tends to regulate the establishment of health care services whereby this is really focused on cost and market impact review, but all of these will be running alongside. Bridgette Keller (BK): Hi there, welcome back to Health Law Diagnosed , a Mintz podcast dedicated to health law, health policy, and social issues in the health care industry. I'm Bridgette Keller, your podcast host. Today, I'm joined by my colleagues Deborah Daccord, Cassie Paolillo, and Kate Stewart, our experts on the long-awaited Massachusetts Bill and Act enhancing the health care market review process. Deb, Cassie, Kate, thanks so much for joining me today. Finally, the Act updates the Massachusetts False Claims Act to create liability for investors in these entities, piercing that corporate veil to these entities that violate the False Claims Act. KS: Thanks, Bridgette. I'm Kate Stewart. I'm Of Counsel in the Boston office as well. And like Cassie and Deb, I advise a number of clients on transactional matters, both Massachusetts-specific and nationwide. And this is a law that we've really been living with in Massachusetts for quite a while. It's been really interesting to see the overall evolution and maturation of the process that has been going on in Massachusetts. DD: They will. Again, this process can run alongside some of these other processes, including, for example, the federal HSR review (Hart-Scott-Rodino) or antitrust review, which has just established its own new regulations that are going to lengthen the term of those reviews. But, yes, providers and their investors can plan on four to nine months of a timeline for this process and we really can't encourage them enough to meet with the staff of the HCP early in the process in order to avoid additional delays and be prepared to respond to all of their information requests. It's going to be important to start very early in the process, term sheet early in the process. BK: Kate, it's really clear why this was in conference or in committee for so long and understanding there were differing votes and all that. I could see the industry stakeholders coming from a variety of different perspectives with all of these new reporting requirements and the scope of oversight. This is entirely different. CP: It is, and I want to note that the first prong of the definition does not include a threshold for the size of the financial interest. So, it would apply to any private equity company that has a financial interest in one of these entities. And so, that entity with an ownership or investment interest would need to know of the violation that took place and fail to disclose that violation to the Commonwealth within 60 days of the identification of the violation. What's interesting here is that the definition of ownership or investment interest is very broad. It does not have any sort of threshold on it as to how large an investor you need to be. BK : I think it's going to be an interesting ride with this new law. And Kate, would you mind rounding us out? Give us a quick introduction, please. BK : I know that oftentimes when there are health care transactions, there are a lot of other associated processes, like a determination of need and other regulatory approvals that need to be required. Are there other considerations that will go alongside this new health care market review process? BK: Yeah, that sounds like great advice, Deb. Well, this conversation has been fascinating. Thank you all so much for your time and for your insights for our listeners. I think that it was valuable and interesting to dig into this law. Deb, you were alluding to this earlier that these changes are really the latest in a wave of state legislation requiring review of health care transactions. So, what do you think? Should we do another podcast episode to talk about what's happening nationwide?", "https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2025/03/12/market-set-to-see-deeper-correction": "Best viewed on Chrome browsers.  \u201cFor the technology sector it is different as they rely on export markets \u2013 the United States especially, with coming tariffs threat. \u201cInvestors must take a step back, since Trump\u2019s policies are well-known to be unpredictable, hence today\u2019s sell-off might be tomorrow\u2019s rebound,\u201d Khaw added. While this remains unresolved at the moment, its fuelling the fragile risk-off appetite as investors shy away from any aggressive positionings for the time being. With the threat of tariffs, sentiment is poised to be bearish for the time being, said iFAST Capital Sdn Bhd senior research analyst Kevin Khaw Khai Sheng. He warned the next few months will likely remain volatile for Bursa Malaysia although Malaysia has some buffers through its economic resilience based on statistics. He said the Nasdaq is now in correction territory, and may be set to undergo a deeper correction as the earnings outlook weakens, which will impact investors sentiment here as well. But it noted Malaysian investors are expected to remain in a defensive stance as relentless foreign equity outflows persist. \u201cOur markets aren\u2019t overvalued as the FBM KLCI is now at some 14 to 15 times price to earnings ratio which is below the median,\u201d Ng said. \u201cAs such, defensive stocks which are characterised by low beta, relatively low foreign shareholding and resilient business models \u2013 are expected to be favoured,\u201d UOBKH Research said in its report. \u201cThe tariffs, likely tied to US trade policies, could trigger another sell-off, especially if they disrupt supply chains or provoke retaliatory measures. The recent sell-off reflects a broader risk-off mode, and these external shocks suggest more pain in the short term,\u201d Khaw told StarBiz. \u201cA swift recovery for Bursa Malaysia appears unlikely. The looming US recession risk and the reciprocal tariffs next month are poised to sustain market volatility. \u201cWith global uncertainties mounting and risk-off sentiment dominating, investors are likely to prioritise capital preservation over aggressive positioning. Thank you for your report! \u201cIn the broader sense, the economy here is resilient and there is no reason why we should trade at such valuations. But the markets are not rational,\u201d Ng said. We would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion. Kindly fill the form below In its strategy report titled \u201cBloodbath Deepens As Slowdown Fears Intensify; Stay Defensive\u201d, UOB Kay Hian (UOBKH) Research said it continues to anticipate a potential softening in the Trump administration\u2019s stance on tariffs by April. PETALING JAYA: Bursa Malaysia and the benchmark FBM KLCI is poised for a lower lows for the time being as the odds of a recession in the United States has risen due to the impact of Trumps tariffs, a pause in the Federal Reserve rate normalisation and resulting weaker consumer and business confidence. \u201cLast year I highlighted there will be correction especially in the United States, but I didn\u2019t expect Malaysia will be so badly impacted. But he points out this is not the beginning of a \u201clong bear market\u201d, instead it is just a pullback as investors start to price in the uncertainties from the new US government. Analysts said the ongoing sell-down on the local market is also due to the threat of reciprocal tariffs by the United States starting next month, much to the chagrin of the rest of the globe, including Malaysia. \u201cOver the longer term, these strengths could support a recovery, but the next few months will likely remain turbulent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile a near-term V-shape recovery for the local exchange seems unlikely, Malaysia\u2019s economic fundamentals and policy efforts provide some resilience,\u201d he said. Further developments here can potentially have a cascading effect on other areas including an unexpected drag on corporate earnings since the uncertainty could see companies pulling back or slowing down capital expenditure plans moving forward. He highlighted the magnitude of the current sell-down: \u201cForeign fund outflows totalled some RM6.6bil in the first 2\u00bd months of the year. Last year, full-year outflows were at RM4.2bil.\u201d Copyright \u00a9 1995-Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)] Following a rout on US markets overnight, the FBM KLCI fell some 16.3 points or 1.06% to 1,520 points at close yesterday, a one-year low as nervous investors moved into risk-off mode. He said there is a possibility that foreign funds could flow back into the region, including Malaysia, in the second half of the year. At this juncture, Ng did not expect corporate earnings to be impacted, and a weakening if any, will likely be due to domestic demand normalising from the earlier festive months. Technically, a chartist with a local brokerage said the charts suggest a downtrend has been formed and any correction in the local market could be temporary with support now seen at the 1,500 point levels for the FBM KLCI. With the exception of China, the rest of Asia saw heavy losses weighed by markets in Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 which declined 0.64%, South Korea\u2019s Kospi that fell 1.28%, Singapore Straits Times Index which lost 1.76% and Taiwan\u2019s Taiex that fell 1.73% at the time of writing yesterday. Tradeview Capital chief executive officer and founder Ng Zhu Hann said this present sell-down on Bursa is \u201cnot yet\u201d a bear market since the broader economic outlook remains unchanged. We hope you enjoy this feature! Wednesday, 12 Mar 2025 \u201cSadly, despite this, the Malaysian economy and Bursa Malaysia are still vulnerable to a potential US recession and the reciprocal tariffs in April 2025, with exports and market sentiment at risk. \u201cCorporate earnings wise, we expect the exporters and manufacturers might be more cautious in expanding or investing into their businesses amid the current scenario, hence a slight pullback might happen in the next few quarters."}, "summary_completions": [[{"article_number": "ARTICLE 14", "article_url": "https://www.aol.com/finance/goldman-sachs-cuts-p-500-135231693.html", "impact_on_term_of_interest": "Goldman Sachs lowered its year-end target for the S&P 500 index to 6200 from 6500, citing a reduced GDP growth forecast for 2025 due to potential impacts from tariffs and political uncertainty.

Renaissance Technologies $22,521,664,000 Icahn Capital LP In the world of investing, the term \u201cmultibagger\u201d refers to stocks that have the potential to deliver returns several times greater than the original investment. One key factor that can help identify potential multibaggers is momentum. Momentum investing focuses on capitalizing on the continuation of existing market trends. Investors using this strategy look for stocks that are experiencing upward price movements, often driven by strong earnings reports, positive news, industry tailwinds, or overall market sentiment. The idea is simple: \u201cthe trend is your friend,\u201d and momentum can be a powerful force in identifying winners before they peak. The importance of momentum has been recognized by famous investors, but many of them emphasized the idea that it is crucial to catch momentum stocks early on. As Warren Buffett put it \u2013 \u201cWhat the wise do in the beginning, fools do in the end\u201d. Innodata Inc.

Warren Buffett The US market is close to entering a correction mode as the absolute magnitude of decline since the mid-February peak is approaching 10%. The current policies of the new US administration, such as tariffs, federal jobs cuts and cuts in some large-scale public projects, are causing havoc among investors as many are fearing a scenario in which the US economy enters stagflation \u2013 a period of high inflation among weak economic growth and unemployment. Some analysts have pointed out that sectors reliant on government contracts, such as infrastructure and defense, are already experiencing heightened volatility as a result of these policy shifts. In a recent interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News, the President himself refused to rule out a recession in the current year and claimed that the economy is in \u201ca period of transition\u201d and that tariffs might fuel inflation at some point. With consumer confidence showing early signs of weakening, as signaled by recent business surveys, some economists argue that the Federal Reserve may be forced to intervene sooner than expected to stabilize the markets. This idea was already supported by the President, who at some point expressed the opinion that interest rates in the US economy are higher than they should be. The aforementioned developments have caused a market selloff, particularly in previously high-momentum stocks such as the Magnificent 8, which have benefited from the AI megatrend and were responsible for most of the market returns last year. Prior to that, many previously well-performing stocks, such as government contractors, had already lost their momentum following the election results, while some of the few well-performing healthcare stocks were hit by Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement threats. Likewise, the energy sector remained somewhat out of favor \u2013 despite volume tailwinds from Trump 2.0, the expectation of lower oil prices amid a weaker economy has put downward pressure on stock prices in the sector. The key takeaway for investors is that one should look for multibaggers that haven\u2019t yet lost their momentum during the market dip in the last month. These are often lower-capitalization companies that are underfollowed by analysts and operate in high-growth markets.

Users with debt from smaller lenders using less advanced technology may find that Stretch doesn\u2019t fully integrate with these institutions. Similarly, those managing finances across multiple countries will likely find the app insufficient for their needs, as Stretch isn\u2019t designed to handle international financial complexities. But there\u2019s good news: Working toward financial goals, such as debt reduction or emergency fund building, typically correlates with increased confidence and security regardless of income level. Financial wellness creates stability that can improve overall quality of life. Stretch does have notable advantages, including its user-friendly interface, emphasis on progress over perfection and the ability to make payments directly through the app. Unlike some competitors, it offers a free version, albeit with significant limitations. In these cases, you might be better served by financial planning software with more advanced features, consulting with a financial advisor, or using free spreadsheet templates designed for budgeting. Financial stress affects more than your bank account. According to the American Psychological Association, 63 percent of Americans cite money as a significant source of stress. This stress can impact mental health, daily functioning and even physical wellbeing. In-app notifications: Through text or email, Stretch provides reminders about financial goals and payments. This financial literacy gap is reflected in Americans\u2019 saving habits. According to\u00a0Bankrate\u2019s 2024 Emergency Savings Report, 32 percent of consumers have less money in savings than they did a year ago, and 9 percent say they have no savings at all. The 2024 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index shows that financial literacy in the U.S. has remained at about 50 percent for eight years, with a 2 percent decline in the past two years. This knowledge gap often leads to financial decisions that can make progress difficult. The competitive budgeting app landscape includes alternatives like You Need a Budget (YNAB) and PocketGuard, which offer similar benefits at comparable price points. Do you need guidance to develop better financial habits but don\u2019t want to hire a financial advisor? Have basic budgeting apps failed to give you the structure and motivation you need?

Before committing, you can take advantage of Stretch\u2019s free trial period to determine if its features align with your financial management style.

If you\u2019re particularly focused on debt management and benefit from real-time feedback, Stretch\u2019s comprehensive dashboard might justify its $12.99 monthly subscription cost. The app can serve as a middle ground between basic free budgeting tools and more expensive financial advisory services. The $12.99 monthly fee for the Vision subscription may be counterproductive for budget-conscious users, especially since the free version only supports one credit card. Considering the average American has 3.84 credit cards, many users would need to upgrade to the paid plan for full functionality.

Stretch aims to differentiate itself from standard budgeting apps by offering more comprehensive tools for financial management. While budgeting apps are plentiful, Stretch offers several useful features: AOL In behavioral economics, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cnudging\u201d \u2014 small, thoughtful prompts that help us make better decisions without being intrusive. Budgeting apps often claim to be that nudge, but not all of them deliver. Some simply log your spending after the fact, while others try to guide you toward smarter money habits in real time. Customized goal setting: Define and track goals like saving for an emergency fund, staying within a budget or paying off debt.

He said: \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d He added, \u201cIt takes a little time. It takes a little time.

During his speech to Congress on March 4, Trump said his tariffs would cause \u201ca little disturbance, but we\u2019re OK with that.\u201d That sounded like a different person than the first-term President Trump, who bragged repeatedly about the economy, whether warranted or not. \u201cWe have talked recently with Washington insiders who think Trump wouldn't mind a recession this year,\u201d Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist for AGF Investments, said in his March 10 newsletter. \u201cThe Democrats \u2014 desperate for an issue \u2014 may have one.\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said recently that the US economy needs a \u201cdetox period,\u201d a concept most economists find perplexing, given that Trump inherited a relatively healthy economy. Bessent says the economy needs more private spending and less reliance on government stimulus, which is generally true. But Congress could fix that gradually through less deficit spending and more prudent budgeting. \u201cDetox\u201d implies uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms that aren\u2019t even necessary, given that there\u2019s no crisis at the moment. Instead, Trump has rolled out tariffs more aggressively than almost anybody expected while showing no concern about unnerving sell-offs in the stock market. Forecasters are now lowering their growth estimates for 2025, raising their inflation estimates, and wondering what in the world Trump is trying to do. Bessent\u2019s marmish admonition is prompting comparisons with Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover\u2019s Treasury Secretary at the beginning of the Great Depression, who advocated severe austerity, no matter how painful, to \u201cpurge the rottenness out of the system.\u201d The Wall Street Journal ran a March 12 analysis suggesting that Trump is taking a similar \u201cliquidationist\u201d approach to the economy by soliciting market failures instead of intervening to stop them. Then during a March 9 Fox News interview, Trump dodged the question when asked if he was expecting a recession this year. \u201cThere is a period of transition,\u201d he said, elliptically. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is very big. It takes time.\u201d Markets bombed the following day, interpreting Trump\u2019s disregard of recession risks as an ominous sign. To reiterate, there were virtually no signs of a looming recession when Biden left office on Jan. 20. In fact, a \u201csoft landing\u201d seemed to be underway in which the Fed wrangled inflation to tolerable levels without choking off spending so much that it caused a recession. The grace period for a new president being able to credibly blame fresh problems on his predecessor is obviously limited, and the sitting president eventually gets all the blame or credit for what happens in the economy. So if Trump truly wants to cause a recession, maybe he should hurry? A \u201cBidencession\u201d narrative is also taking root in Trump-friendly media. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if Joe Biden\u2019s recession shows up,\u201d a Fox News host said on March 7. Yet investors are stunned by the damage Trump has done to the economy in just two months. When Trump took office on Jan. 20, GDP growth was a solid 2.5%, the unemployment rate was a low 4.1%, and stocks were on a nice post-election run-up. Investors expected a \u201cTrump bump\u201d to keep the good times rolling, maybe even enliven the party.

AOL Trump and his allies have already started blaming Biden for economic setbacks occurring on Trump\u2019s watch. While trying to explain a brutal 20-day stock market sell-off on March 11, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \u201cWe are in a period of transition from the mess that was created under Joe Biden. In the previous administration. Joe Biden left this country in an economic disaster.\u201d Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Unless, that is, part of Trump\u2019s plan is to deliberately stress the economy during his first year in office. Many investors originally thought Trump would threaten severe tariffs but impose far less stringent measures. That storyline has now lapsed. Trump has aggressively ratcheted up his tariffs, and instead of easing up to give stocks a breather \u2014 the typical pattern during his first trade war in 2018 \u2014 he has basically looked the other way. \u201cYou can\u2019t really watch the stock market,\u201d Trump said on March 10. It\u2019s hard to imagine any normal president trying to deliberately weaken the economy. Recessions are highly unpredictable and even when they\u2019re officially over, high unemployment and depressed living standards can linger for months or years, bringing down any politician they\u2019re associated with. Team Tariff may be signaling that, unlike Trump\u2019s first trade war in 2018 and 2019, they\u2019re not going to let up on tariffs just because markets squeal. The economic \u201ctransition\u201d Trump now envisions seems to be far more sweeping than the limited tariffs that marginally raised prices during his first term. If that\u2019s what he plans, then a painful period of supply chain disruptions, higher prices, lower profits, and possibly layoffs may be necessary to achieve whatever the long-term gain might be. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter. Now that Donald Trump\u2019s second presidential term has gotten off to a rocky start, there\u2019s mounting suspicion that if a recession develops soon, Trump won\u2019t hesitate to blame it on Biden. There\u2019s a more radical corollary: Trump might not even mind tipping the economy into recession early in his term while it\u2019s easier to argue that it\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault. Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Economists don\u2019t see a lot of long-term gain, but they\u2019re already measuring the short-term pain. Some economists have raised their odds of a recession since Trump took office to the range of 30% to 40%. Many others, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have cut their growth forecasts but stopped short of predicting a recession.", "https://www.reinsurancene.ws/am-best-us-health-insurance-industry-faces-challenges-but-continues-to-stay-profitable/": " We have 225,000+ readers every month & 27,000+ email subscribers. Reach the largest reinsurance audience. Although insurers have attempted to curb these rising costs by steering patients toward lower-cost care options, such as at-home treatments, the growing number of new drugs in the pipeline for 2025 suggests that pharmaceutical expenses will remain a key challenge for the industry. \u0394 The sharp rise in the number of people taking GLP-1 drugs has further accelerated pharmacy claims, which now represent over 13% of total medical claims. Yet, the health insurance sector as a whole saw a significant drop in underwriting gains, with a 65% decrease to $17.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period the previous year. The report attributes this decline to various factors, including inadequate pricing adjustments in the Medicare Advantage segment. The industry recorded a net income of $31 billion for the period, but increasing medical and pharmaceutical costs have put pressure on profit margins.

Rate hikes needed to adjust for this higher-risk population have been slower than necessary, leading to margin pressures in the Medicaid segment. Looking ahead, AM Best projects that the US health insurance industry will remain profitable through the end of 2024, with similar trends continuing into 2025. \u201cFor the past several years, the industry balanced lower earnings in the commercial segment with steady and increasing profitability in the government program segments, but this trend has reversed as earnings in MA and Medicaid managed care have been challenged while the commercial segment\u2019s premium trend continues to offset the narrowing margins of the several years prior,\u201d added Joseph Zazzera, Director, AM Best. Pricing for 2024 did not sufficiently factor in the uptick in medical costs from 2023 or the increased utilisation of healthcare services. Additionally, regulatory factors\u2014such as changes to Star ratings, risk adjustment payments, and reimbursement rates\u2014are expected to continue pressuring margins in the MA segment through 2025. Pharmaceutical costs also remain a significant concern, driven by an increase in the use of expensive drugs such as biosimilars, gene therapies, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) medications. The report highlights that while the US health insurance industry saw favourable operating performance through the third quarter of 2024, it faced challenges in underwriting, primarily in Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicaid managed care due to rising healthcare costs, particularly in pharmaceuticals.

Reinsurance News Despite cost trends surpassing historical levels, insurers have adjusted their pricing to account for these higher costs. This proactive pricing approach is expected to sustain profitability in the commercial segment through both the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.

The commercial segment, however, is expected to remain strong, supported by continued premium growth, the ageing of seniors into Medicare Advantage plans, and rate hikes across various product lines. The commercial health insurance segment, however, performed well in 2023, with a 75% increase in underwriting gains compared to the previous year, fuelled by a rise in premium revenue from the individual market.

The reported operating profit margin decreased to 9.8% of sales (2023: 18.3%), primarily due to the negative volume effect, which resulted in missing economies of scale. Cost control measures helped alleviate the impact of lower sales volumes and adverse exchange rate effects. The adjusted EBITDA3 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) for this segment was CHF 79.1 million, compared to CHF 105.5 million in 2023.

Adjusted net profit2 was CHF 103.1 million, down from CHF 164.4 million in 2023, when earnings were significantly boosted by a one-time positive effect related to transitional measures from the Swiss tax reform.

Examples include Tecan's collaboration with Illumina in the Synergence line, supporting their expansion into multi-omics with the development of a new system. Through Paramit, Tecan assisted THINK\u00ae Surgical with the design transfer and initiated the manufacturing of their TMINI\u00ae miniature robotic system, cart, and smart cell charging station. Additionally, Paramit is manufacturing the Avive Connect AED, an innovative and user-friendly automated external defibrillator aimed at improving survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest. The Partnering Business generated sales of CHF 537.3 million in 2024 (2023: CHF 622.6 million or CHF 613.1 million in local currencies), marking a decrease of 13.7% in Swiss francs and 12.4% in local currencies. As anticipated, Tecan did not record any meaningful sales from the pass-through of material costs in this segment for 2024, compared to CHF 8.0 million in 2023. About Tecan Tecan CEO Dr. Achim von Leoprechting commented: \"Tecan is navigating a challenging market environment marked by reduced spending in our target markets, leading to lower demand in both the Life Sciences and Partnering Business segments. These challenges have been compounded by general market weakness in China and specific customer-related factors. In response, we have implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program and optimized our global operations to reinforce our leading position. The long-term trends in healthcare remain unchanged: from life science research to clinical applications, automation and innovation are crucial for scaling healthcare solutions in research, clinical diagnostics, and medtech. This is especially important amid rising healthcare costs, ultimately benefiting people worldwide. With our dedicated team, we are driving exciting innovations and look forward to launching promising new products across both businesses, positioning us well to capitalize on market recovery as conditions improve.\" In 2024, Tecan enhanced its operational resilience by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and continuing to optimize its global organizational footprint. Following the successful transfer of Cavro component production to facilities in Morgan Hill, California, and Penang, Malaysia, and the closure of the San Jose site in 2023, Tecan relocated its genomic reagents site from Redwood City to the expanding Morgan Hill hub at the end of 2024. In Penang, Tecan successfully passed an extensive FDA inspection, laying a strong foundation for future production of medical devices, including class 3 devices. The first medical device production was successfully transitioned to Penang in 2024. Alongside site consolidation, Tecan focused on supply chain optimization and increased vertical integration of manufacturing to leverage the Group's full capabilities and realize cost synergies. Innovation and product launches in the Life Sciences Business In 2024, Tecan demonstrated its commitment to agile cost management amid evolving economic conditions and revenue trends by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and optimizing its global organizational footprint. These efforts are designed to protect profitability without limiting the company's growth potential. As a result, Tecan forecasts an adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding restructuring, acquisition- and integration-related costs, of 17.5-18.5% of sales. Outlook Adjusted EBITDA1 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) was CHF 164.4 million, down from CHF 220.6 million in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 17.6% of sales (2023: 20.5%), aligning with the revised margin outlook of 16-18%. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, as profitability is highly volume-dependent. However, profitability was supported by a comprehensive cost-reduction program. Additionally, exchange rate movements in major currencies against the Swiss franc negatively impacted the margin by approximately 40 basis points. Order entry in the Partnering Business for the full year decreased slightly more than sales as OEM customers adjusted their ordering patterns, shifting from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized.

M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland, March 12, 2025 - The Tecan Group (SIX Swiss Exchange: TECN) today announced its full set of audited financial results for 2024, underscoring its commitment to enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions. The company also initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025. Proposal for a stable dividend at the Annual General Meeting The full 2024 Annual Report and the 2024 Sustainability Report were also published today and can be accessed on the company's website www.tecan.com under Investor Relations. On the commercial front, Tecan established a direct sales office in South Korea in 2024 by acquiring a long-standing distributor in the region. This new entity includes team members with over 20 years of experience working with Tecan, bringing valuable local market knowledge to better serve this growing market. In 2024, reduced spending in the biopharmaceutical industry led to decreased demand for life science research instruments, affecting both the Life Sciences Business and the Partnering Business. Additionally, a general market weakness in China impacted both direct sales and indirect business through global OEM customers. In the Partnering Business, sales were further influenced by specific customer-related factors, including normalized demand patterns following inventory replenishment by a key customer in 2023. As a result, reported sales for the Group in fiscal year 2024 decreased by 13.0% in Swiss francs, totaling CHF 934.3 million (2023: CHF 1,074.4 million). In local currencies, sales were 11.5% below the prior-year period, aligning with the revised sales outlook from October 2024, which anticipated a decline of 12-14%. Sales in the second half decreased by 12.3% in Swiss francs and by 11.3% in local currencies compared to the prior-year period. These sales results were previously communicated in a trading statement on January 8, 2025. New launches and rich project pipeline in Partnering Business Tecan's 2024 Sustainability Report, published as part of the Annual Report, includes a Climate Risk Scenarios Analysis, highlighting the company's proactive approach to addressing transition and physical risks related to climate change. In preparation for the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Tecan has integrated related data management into its Finance function. For the first time, Tecan's financial auditors conducted a limited assurance audit of key 2024 environmental and social data points. Further progress was made towards greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, with renewable sources accounting for 87% of all electricity purchased. In 2025, Tecan will continue its pragmatic approach to managing risks and opportunities associated with the company's material topics.

Tel. +41 (0) 44 922 84 30 Highlights 2024 The dial-in numbers for the conference call are as follows: Reported EBIT amounted to CHF\u00a046.6 million (2023: CHF\u00a064.4 million), while the reported operating profit margin reached 8.7% of sales (2023: 10.3%). Similar to the Life Sciences Business segment, lower sales volumes and the resulting negative economies of scale were the main factors affecting margin development. The Annual General Meeting of Tecan's shareholders will take place on April 10, 2025A Q1 2025 Qualitative Update will be published on May 12, 2025The 2025 Interim Report will be published on August 12, 2025A Q3 2025 Qualitative Update will be published on October 13, 2025 1 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 16.4 million) Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications & IR Key upcoming dates Financial results for the full year 2024 - Highlights The expectations regarding profitability are based on an average exchange rate forecast for full year 2025 of one euro equaling CHF 0.95 and one US dollar equaling CHF 0.90. Tecan Group www.tecan.com [email\u00a0protected] The outlook 2025 does not take account of potential acquisitions during the course of the year. Tecan also expanded its digital ecosystem with the new Introspect analytics platform, enhancing operational insights and service efficiency. This digital expansion benefits customers across both business segments. The pipeline of new development projects has been further enriched through joint selling of Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit services, targeting key customers in the life sciences, lab diagnostics, and Medtech segments. Tecan aims to double new project signings by 2027 through joint selling efforts, a targeted approach, and strategic account management. The lower demand for life science instrumentation also had a negative impact on the Partnering Business, influencing both the Cavro\u00ae OEM components business and the contract development and manufacturing revenues for life science instruments in the Paramit product line. Market weakness in China also impacted the Cavro OEM components business and sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence\u2122 product line to larger global OEM customers with significant exposure to China. However, outside China, sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence product line developed positively, with increased contributions from newly launched systems. Sales in the Paramit product line, which served medical market customers, were negatively affected by normalized demand patterns following the replenishment of depleted inventories in 2023, when supply chain disruptions eased, and by the anticipated reduction in sales from the pure pass-through of material costs. These impacts were specific to a single customer and included a model transition, rather than being related to end market conditions. All these factors had a more pronounced impact in the second half of the year, when segment sales decreased by 15.9% in local currencies. Tecan (www.tecan.com) improves people's lives and health by empowering customers to scale healthcare innovation globally from life science to the clinic. Tecan is a pioneer and global leader in laboratory automation. As an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Tecan is also a leader in developing and manufacturing OEM instruments, components and medical devices that are then distributed by partner companies. Founded in Switzerland in 1980, the company has 3,300 employees, with manufacturing, research and development sites in Europe, North America and Asia, and maintains a sales and service network in over 70 countries. In 2024, Tecan generated sales of CHF 934 million (USD 1,062 million; EUR 984 million). Registered shares of Tecan Group are traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange (TECN; ISIN CH0012100191). Press Release with financial tables Enhancing operational resilience through cost-reduction initiatives, while expanding global operations and commercial reach Sales in the Life Sciences Business in 2024 reached CHF 397.0 million (2023: CHF 451.8 million or CHF 442.1 million in local currencies), reflecting a decrease of 12.1% in Swiss francs and 10.2% in local currencies. Reduced CAPEX spending by the biopharmaceutical industry globally, along with government and academic customers in the US, resulted in decreased demand for life science research instruments. Additionally, market weakness in China negatively impacted demand, as the announced stimulus program failed to provide any impetus in 2024. Instead, it prompted some customers to delay orders while awaiting funding decisions. Contributing to a more favorable sales development in the Life Sciences Business were recovering consumables sales post-pandemic, a solid service business due to a higher installed base of instruments, and continued strong demand for newly launched products, particularly from genomic diagnostics companies. Recurring sales of services, consumables and reagents increased to 57.6% of segment sales (2023: 52.8%). Attachment 3 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Life Sciences Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 6.4 million). The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Partnering Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 5.3 million). Life Sciences Business (end-customer business) Tecan also reiterated its mid-term outlook, in which the company anticipates returning to average organic growth rates in the mid to high single-digit percentage range in local currencies under normal market conditions, while continuously improving profitability. In the second half of 2024, the Life Sciences Business segment experienced moderate order entry growth in local currencies compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio slightly above 1 for the full year. The overall market environment is showing first signs of stabilization after a significant decline in demand last year, with further improvements expected over the course of 2025. However, new political uncertainties have emerged, including the announced reductions to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research budget in the US, which could further impact demand for life science research instruments. For 2025, Tecan anticipates that the year will begin with continued softer market conditions, with potential improvement as the year progresses. Depending on the extent of this improvement in the second half, the market could turn slightly positive for the full year, driven by specific growth segments, such as the clinical diagnostics market. Acknowledging the current market conditions, Tecan has initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025, with a full-year guidance range from a low single-digit decline to low single-digit growth in sales in local currencies. The company expects sales in local currencies to decline in the first half, with a softer first quarter and a sequential improvement in the second quarter. A more positive outlook for the second half is supported by a strong reception of newly launched products and partnerships in both divisions, along with additional launches in 2025. Financial results full-year and second half of 2024 Annual Report and Webcast Cash flow from operating activities was CHF 148.5 million, compared to CHF 160.6 million in 2023. Cash conversion improved to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%). Thanks to solid cash flow management, Tecan's net liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term time deposits, less bank liabilities, loans, and the outstanding bond) increased to CHF 153.7 million as of December 31, 2024, up from CHF 112.6 million on December 31, 2023. In 2024, Tecan advanced its product portfolio with significant launches in genomics, proteomics, and cell biology. Examples include the Resolvex i300 module, introduced in February, which enhances throughput in proteomics by integrating with the Fluent\u00ae platform, and the Spark Cyto 3D, which supports drug discovery by enabling the analysis of complex 3D cell models. During a Capital Markets Day in October 2024, Tecan previewed Veya\u2122, a multi-omics liquid handling workstation that simplifies lab automation and boosts productivity. Officially launched at the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (SLAS) international conference in San Diego, USA, in January 2025, Veya provides effortless automation by overcoming key barriers in lab automation. In the second half of the year, sales declined by 5.0% in local currencies, following the sharp 15.5% decline in the first half. Sequentially, the Life Sciences Business segment grew by 13.6% in local currencies when comparing the second half of 2024 to the first half. Martin Br\u00e4ndle For further information: Tecan reports 2024 financial results, enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions Full-year order entry was CHF 903.6 million, a decrease of 12.1% compared to CHF 1,028.1 million in 2023, reflecting a 10.5% decline in local currencies. The Partnering Business segment was impacted by a shift in OEM customer ordering patterns, moving from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Meanwhile, the Life Sciences Business segment saw moderate order entry growth in local currencies in the second half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

So far, inflation has cooled according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the full extent of any tariffs on price increases in March would not be known until April at the earliest given the one-month reporting lag. Top Garden State exports to our neighbor to the north include: Canada and the European Union are set to impose 25% tariffs on tens of billions of dollars in goods made in the U.S., as economic tensions ramp up among longstanding allies and trade partners. He still imposed 25% tariffs on those metals coming into the U.S from any country, including Canada, effective Wednesday morning, a move New Jersey manufacturers said would increase costs that would likely be passed onto consumers. Meanwhile, Canadian officials meanwhile slapped over $20 billion of tariffs on U.S exports. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump threatened 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum coming into the U.S from Canada, but backed off hours later. Tariffs are essentially taxes on imports, and economists generally agree that the cost gets passed to consumers, putting brakes on the economy.

New Jersey companies annually export $10.1 billion of goods to the EU, according to the EU\u2019s Directorate-General for Trade. Trump and his administration rebuffed fears that tariffs could trigger a recession but conceded that there could be some higher prices. Trump was initially set to impose 25% tariffs this month on imports from Canada and Mexico, but gave two separate one-month extensions; once in February and again in March.", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/12/business/consumer-price-index/": "Egg prices rose another 10.4 percent in February, as an outbreak of bird flu continued to exacerbate a nationwide egg shortage. Prices for that grocery staple are up nearly 60 percent since last year. Food prices more broadly rose 0.2 percent, or 2.8 percent compared with the same time last year. That suggests the Fed will extend its pause on rate cuts when officials gather next week, maintaining the current range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent. Airfares also fell 4 percent in February and are down nearly 1 percent on an annual basis. Housing-related costs also notched the smallest 12-month gain since December 2021, with the shelter index up 4.2 percent. Between January and February, it rose 0.3 percent. Newsletters Terms of Purchase Staff List Digital Access Inflation eased more than expected in February, a welcome sign for the Federal Reserve as it grapples with the prospect of a sharp slowdown in growth as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. Log In Order Back Issues Feedback A combination of slowing growth and resurgent price pressures puts the Fed in a difficult position, given its mandate to pursue low, stable inflation as well as a healthy labor market. Internship Program Advertisement Customer Service Uncertainty about the trajectory of the president\u2019s trade policies have amplified fears that businesses will begin to freeze hiring and investment in a more significant way as they await clarity on the scope and scale of Trump\u2019s plans. When the Fed had to deal with a trade war during Trump\u2019s first term, it lowered interest rates by a total of three-quarters of a percent in 2019 in an effort to protect the economy from weakening further. This article originally appeared in The New York Times. Home Delivery Prices for used cars rose 0.9 percent in February, although those for new vehicles declined slightly. Car insurance, which was a huge driver of the index\u2019s unexpectedly large increase in January, rose again, but at a much slower pace of 0.3 percent. It is up just over 11 percent over the past year. The consumer price index was up 2.8 percent from a year earlier, after rising another 0.2 percent on a monthly basis. That was a step down from January\u2019s surprisingly large 0.5 percent increase and came in below economists\u2019 expectations. Delivery Issues Co-op Program View the ePaper Powell added that the Fed\u2019s typical response to tariffs would be to \u201clook through\u201d any one-time increase, but stressed that officials would be watching for any shocks and how long-term inflation expectations were shifting. \u201cAs we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\u201d News in Education Economists worry that Trump\u2019s tariffs and the global trade war they have provoked will interrupt this progress and eventually stoke price pressures again while denting growth. Advertise Manage My Account The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underscored the bumpy nature of the Fed\u2019s progress toward its 2 percent goal. Prices for consumer staples, such as eggs and other grocery items, are rising steeply again, but costs for other categories like gasoline fell. Work at Boston Globe Media As of January, Fed officials justified their ability to hold off on another round of interest rate cuts and wait for more progress on inflation because the economy was doing well. If that resilience starts to show signs of cracking before inflation is fully vanquished, the Fed may be more limited in how it responds. Those concerns have also materialized in recent measures tracking how consumers feel about the future. According to the latest survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consumers\u2019 expectations about their financial situation in the year ahead \u201cdeteriorated considerably,\u201d as they braced for inflation sticking to around 3.1 percent. The share of consumers now expecting to be in a worse situation financially a year from now rose to its highest point since November 2023. The average perceived likelihood of missing a future debt payment rose to the highest level since April 2020.

Do Not Sell My Personal Information Terms of Service Help & FAQs In his most detailed comments yet about Trump\u2019s tariffs, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged last week that the economic backdrop this time was different. \u201cWe came off a very high inflation and we haven\u2019t fully returned to 2 percent on a sustainable basis,\u201d he said at an event Friday.", "https://trinidadexpress.com/business/local/major-oil-companies-paid-us-7-4b-to-t-t-between-2015-and-2022/article_fb2a1c04-fee7-11ef-9ff5-d7915f7f0331.html": " In addition to this, the government also launched an auction for deepwater oil and gas exploration to ensure sustained energy output. Projects like Shell\u2019s Manatee and BP\u2019s Cypre are anticipated to enhance gas supply by 2028, further strengthening forex earnings. The energy sector, which includes oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals, has historically accounted for about 80% of Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s export revenues. While these payments significantly contribute to government revenue, a portion is paid in foreign currency. These efforts aimed to bolster the country\u2019s energy production while ensuring that Trinidad and Tobago remained competitive in the global market. The pandemic led to global shutdowns, forcing businesses, schools, and public services to close. Many employees transitioned to remote work, while others faced job losses as companies struggled to stay afloat. The economic downturn resulted in widespread closures, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being particularly vulnerable. Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device. The TTEITI stated that the total payments trend highlights a fluctuating pattern driven by significant surges in specific years, heavily influenced by BP and Shell\u2019s contributions.

In late 2023, T&T renegotiated contracts related to its flagship project, Atlantic LNG, leading to increased government revenue from liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. It explained that energy companies contribute to T&T\u2019s forex availability because T&T has an integrated gas value chain with upstream companies exploring for and producing oil and gas, midstream companies processing, transporting and marketing gas, and downstream companies using gas as a fuel and feedstock for petrochemical production. Five years after the Covid-19 outbreak, businesses in Trinidad and Tobago are still grappling with its lasting effects. The government launched Vision 2030 in 2016 as part of its long-term plan to transition towards a more diversified economy. It emphasised the development of sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, and information technology to reduce dependence on oil and gas revenues. The vision aimed to create sustainable economic growth, generate new employment opportunities, and improve the country\u2019s overall economic resilience in the face of global energy market fluctuations. Between 2021 and 2022, as the world recovered from Covid-19-related delays, global energy demand surged, bolstering T&T\u2019s forex reserves. THE shareholders of the restructured Atlantic LNG, bp, Shell, and the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago, have agreed to separate Train 1 from the rest of the Atlantic facility in preparation for its permanent shutdown, according to the latest annual report of energy giant bp. We have partnered with so many of you over the last two years, emphasizing the importance of mutually beneficial strategic partnerships and collaboration. MAJOR oil and gas companies paid US$7.4 billion to the government of Trinidad and Tobago between 2015 and 2022, according to the Trinidad and Tobago Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (TTEITI) report published last month. Good morning, I\u2019m so thankful that we got so many of you to join us this morning for yet another milestone in CLICO Credit Union\u2019s almost 80-year journey of service, growth, and unwavering commitment to our members and the communities we serve.

In the meantime, the TTEITI reported that bpTT had a substantial spike in payments in 2015 and 2022, contributing to a total surpassing US$2.5 billion that year, while subsequent years saw a decline in its contribution. \u201cMidstream and downstream companies currently do not remit their taxes in USD. In the budget, the Minister of Finance signalled an intent to amend existing legislation to mandate these companies to pay their tax obligations in US dollars. Based on data from the Gas Master Plan, between 2009-2014, these midstream and downstream companies contributed US$31.2 billion in corporation taxes. By ensuring these companies pay in US dollars, the government will be adding to the forex pool,\u201d the TTEITI stated. The new terms allowed LNG cargoes to be sold at 15% to 55% above the Henry Hub benchmark, ensuring greater returns compared to previous agreements. This revamp allowed T&T to maximise returns from its natural gas resources at a time when global LNG demand remains strong. \u201cShell displays sharp increases in 2019 and 2022, significantly impacting the total for that year, which again exceeds US$1.5 billion. Other companies, such as EOG Resources and the National Gas Company (NGC), made relatively consistent but smaller contributions, totalling US$1.3 billion and US$1.5 billion, respectively. BHP/Woodside\u2019s payments range from US$4.2 million to US$154 million over the period,\u201d the report stated. \u201cOver the eight-year period reviewed, 2022 and in some cases 2015, coincided with the highest USD payments received for the companies. This is attributed to higher commodity prices in 2022 despite lower production levels, compared to 2015, which saw increased production but lower prices,\u201d it highlighted. \u201cThe Atlantic Train 1 plant has not been operational since 2020. The Atlantic shareholders, bp, Shell and the National Gas Company of Trinidad & Tobago (NGC), agreed to decouple the Train from the rest of the Atlantic facility with a view to decommissioning it. The Train has been made safe and decoupling and decommissioning work scopes are being planned,\u201d bp stated.

However, two years later, oil and gas prices stabilised, resulting in a moderate recovery of forex earnings. Initiatives were also introduced to enhance production efficiency and attract foreign investment in the energy sector. Instagram Between 2015 and 2017, the global decline in oil prices led to reduced revenues from the energy sector. The government acknowledged the need for diversification to mitigate dependency on energy exports. This prompted initiatives to encourage investment in non-energy sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, aiming to create a more resilient economy and reduce vulnerability to fluctuating energy prices.", "https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/trump-reconsiders-50-tariffs-after-canada-suspends-electricity-surcharge-on-us/3774937/": "https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.6c83017.1741800563.18473d46 Reference #18.6c83017.1741800563.18473d46https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.6c83017.1741800563.18473d46", "https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/11-best-pharma-stocks-to-buy-according-to-hedge-funds-1479410/": "George Soros  David Einhorn NYSE:BMYNYSE:ZTSNYSE:PFEHeadlineNYSE:MRKNYSE:LLYNYSE:JNJNYSE:ABBVNASDAQ:VRTXNASDAQ:AMGNNASDAQ:GILDNASDAQ:REGNDaily NewsletterPfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)Zoetis Inc (NYSE:ZTS)AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV)Amgen Inc.

Although the potential reasons for this trend vary, experts believe this scenario is here to stay. While it is anticipated to affect the US pharmaceutical sector, how these repercussions might materialize is unclear. Some experts believe it could ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at a low price; others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry. CNBC reported that Tim Opler, a managing director in Stifel\u2019s global healthcare group, said the following about the situation: Leon Cooperman Soros Fund Management Jim Simons Talking about the tariffs, she said that their materialization poses a big open question for the pharmaceutical sector as some companies assemble their products in the US after manufacturing them abroad. Manufacturing costs are thus pretty low for these companies, which is a significant point to consider when determining the impact of tariffs. She believed that absorbing the additional cost of the tariffs would be very manageable for these companies. The market has reached the tail-end of the earnings season, and the situation hasn\u2019t come up much on earnings calls over this quarter.\u201d Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 Point72 Asset Management Despite struggles in the healthcare sector, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) has outperformed the broader market and its biotech peers since 2022. It holds a dominant position in the cystic fibrosis market and is expanding its offerings beyond it. The company recently attained approval for Alyftrek to treat CF, further consolidating its presence in the market. It has low market competition and patents locked up into the 2030s, which is why investors are bullish on the stock. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a watershed moment where the pharma industry is like, \u2018We don\u2019t really need to buy U.S. biotechs necessarily. We will if it makes sense, but we can buy perfectly good biotech assets through licensing deals with Chinese companies.\u201d John Paulson $4,198,712,000 The US pharmaceutical sector is experiencing a distinct trend never seen before with large American pharma companies continually looking for medicines in China. According to data from DealForma, as reported by CNBC, around 30% of Big Pharma deals with at least $50 million upfront in 2024 included Chinese companies. This was up from 20% the year before and almost 0% only five years prior. Experts are attributing several reasons to this trend. Some believe that Chinese pharmaceutical companies are attracting attention because of their advanced development capabilities that are producing effective molecules in substantial quantities. These Chinese companies are also in a position to assign a lower price to these medicines compared to the US, and are capable of initiating their testing on human subjects quicker. According to CNBC, buyers have devised a business model allowing them to import medicines through licensing deals. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China.

Greenlight Capital Omega Advisors Another reason behind this bullish sentiment is the recent regulatory approval Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) attained for Journavx (formerly known as suzetrigine) to treat acute pain. The drug does not have the addiction risks associated with opioid painkillers and delivers excellent pain relief, ranking this oral non-opioid pain signal inhibitor among the first new class of pain medicine in over 20 years.

Have you missed out on the performance of mid and small-cap stocks in the past couple of years?As a fund house, we have an agnostic approach to market capitalisation. We are not averse to investing in mid and small cap stocks. However, our investment process is focused on quality filters such as earnings growth, price-to-earning multiples, and return on capital.Many of the mid cap companies that have performed well in the past couple of years did not meet our strict quality criteria when they were ready to be bought. By the time they matched our filters, their valuations had already run up significantly.Also in a portfolio management context, we need to consider the liquidity of the portfolio and the ability to manage client redemptions. Small and mid cap stocks can be less liquid, which poses challenges in this regard.While we are not fundamentally opposed to mid and small cap stocks, our focus on quality and liquidity management led us to miss out on some of the outsized returns in these segments of the market.What is the market-cap distribution of your portfolio?Our portfolio is primarily focused on large cap companies. To give you a sense of the market cap composition, the median market cap of our portfolio in 2023 was around  \u20b980,000 crore.Also read: Don't let steep fees derail higher education dreams\u2014smart ways to plan aheadAround 65-70% of our portfolio comprises large cap companies, with the remaining 30-35% in mid cap stocks. We generally avoid small cap companies due to liquidity concerns and our focus on quality.It's important to note that our definition of large, mid, and small cap is not strictly based on index definitions but more on our internal assessment of liquidity, market cap and quality.What is your view on the use of cash calls in portfolio management services?We refrain from the use of cash calls in PMS. Our experience has shown that these tend to lead to poor performance. The rationale behind this is that no one can accurately predict market movements, and trying to time the market through cash calls often backfires.We believe a PMS manager's role is to remain invested and generate returns for clients over the long term. Cash calls disrupt this core objective and can significantly impact the portfolio's performance.We prefer to manage risk through other instruments and techniques, such as diversification, position sizing, and selective hedging if required. But the fundamental approach is to remain invested and ride out market cycles rather than trying to time the market.Do you avoid multinationals in your portfolio?We don\u2019t entirely avoid MNCs in our portfolios. However, our analysis has shown that Indian entrepreneur-owned companies have demonstrated superior earnings growth, capital efficiency, and overall management quality compared to multinationals operating in India.Also read | Advance tax: Here's how to calculate and pay your final instalment for the yearOur research and backtesting have shown that these companies, on average, have outperformed multinationals and other ownership structures in the Indian market. This is not to say that multinationals are not good investments, rather that we have found the Indian entrepreneur-owned segment to be particularly compelling in terms of risk-adjusted returns.We do have exposure to MNCs in some of our other portfolios, where we believe they fit well within the overall investment strategy and portfolio construction. Our primary aim is to provide clients with the best-performing companies, irrespective of ownership structure, as long as they meet our quality criteria.What are clients\u2019 preferences regarding fee structures of your PMS offerings?Interestingly, our clients generally prefer fixed-fee structures over performance-based fees, despite our own preference for the latter.As a house, we believe that a performance-based fee model, in which the manager is incentivised to generate alpha, is a more aligned and appropriate structure. However, we have found that most of our clients in India choose the fixed-fee option, which is about 2.5% in our case.This is in contrast to global markets, where performance-based fees are more commonly accepted and even expected by investors.

However, in the past couple of years, the market was chasing certain sectors and companies that were not part of our investment universe. For example, the market was very excited about government-owned companies in sectors such as power finance. These companies, by definition, did not fit our filters and investment approach. As a result, our portfolios missed out on the performance of these sectors, which led to some underperformance of our portfolios compared to the broader market. After the elections, we identified certain sectors that we believed would be the new drivers of growth in India. These included manufacturing, driven by the \u2018China plus one\u2019 strategy and PLI (production-linked incentive) schemes, as well as the energy transition theme.", "https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/trump-tariff-threats-present-opportunity-for-india-too-much-protection-detrimental-to-growth-shamika-ravi-12963010.html": " Why protectionism hurts \u201cIn the last four months they have removed a lot of protectionist measures they had.

US President Donand Trump's April 2 deadline on reciprocal tariffs on India is nearing. However, the meaning of reciprocal tariffs continues to be unclear considering the trade profiles of both nations is very different. India\u2019s imports from the United States include mineral fuels and oils, pearls and stones, nuclear reactors, electrical machinery etc, while exports comprise textiles, marine products, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, electronics, among others.

The government\u2019s objective has to be nature of trade which will lead to tech transfers, which will raise productivity. Without investing in R&D, it will be very difficult to continue to protect domestic markets.\u201d Referring to President Trump\u2019s call to increase tariffs across nations, she added that this will have an impact on China as well. President Trump imposed 10 per cent tariffs on all imports from China in February and raised the tariff subsequently to 20 per cent. China, she noted, has reduced its protectionist policies especially in the last few months. She added that the global economy is changing and India has an enormous task of industrializing the economy. \"Giving too much protection and access to domestic market without sufficient competition will be detrimental to trade and in the long run detrimental to our growth.\u201d \u201cWe will have to bring in all measures to raise the competitiveness of our markets. Many sectors in our economy have enjoyed protection for some time. When you have seen protectionist measures in other markets - it\u2019s through export subsidies, targeted towards exports. Most of the other markets have protected trade by way of the state bearing the cost of either improvement in quality of the product, which means export or basic subsidies.\u00a0This has led to production of world class products.

On Wednesday, perhaps the first sign of better economic data emerged as a softer-than-expected inflation reading sent the major stock indexes higher at the market open. For premium support please call: A nearly 10% fall in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has prompted Wall Street strategists to revaluate their bullish views headed into 2025. \"The risks of a drawdown of more than 10% have admittedly grown, however. If that occurs, we see a 'growth scare' of a 14-20% decline from peak as most likely, which could shift us into our bear case.\" And late Tuesday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin became the first big name on the Street to lower their year-end price target for the S&P 500 following this drop, with Kostin cutting his year-end target to 6,200 from 6,500. AOL \"Our new index target suggests an 11% price gain during the balance of the year, similar to our return estimate at the start of the year but from a lower starting point.\" Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Having sparked a North American trade war and with the S&P 500 losing all of its post-election gains, Trump said in his speech to Congress: \u201cTariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again, and it\u2019s happening and it will happen rather quickly. There\u2019ll be a little disturbance, but we\u2019re OK with that. It won't be much.\" \u201cSTOCK MARKETS CRASHING. I TOLD YOU SO!!! KAMALA DOESN\u2019T HAVE A CLUE. BIDEN IS SOUND ASLEEP.

Dec. 12, 2024, in an interview with CNBC at the New York Stock Exchange: \u201cI think the stock market is going to be great. In other words, we will rapidly grow our economy by dramatically shrinking the federal government.\u201d \u201cWell, I think I\u2019ve always said, you know, to me, stock market is very \u2014 all of it, you know, all of it together, it\u2019s very important.

There are many people that are saying that the only reason the Stock Market is high is because I am leading in all of the Polls, and if I don\u2019t win, we will have a CRASH of similar proportions to 1929. I agree, but let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t have to worry about that!\u201d Over the last year, while President Joe Biden was in office, Trump took credit for stock market rallies as a vote of confidence in his electoral prospects. When the market dipped, he blamed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. And he predicted that if Democrats won the 2024 presidential election, the stock market would have crashed. When asked about his hesitation during the \"Sunday Morning Futures\" interview before answering the recession question, Trump said: \u201cI tell you what, of course you hesitate. Who knows? All I know is this: We\u2019re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we\u2019re going to become so rich you\u2019re not going to know where to spend all that money.

I think this country's going to boom. But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way. The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing, but the results are going to be 20 times greater. Remember, Trump is always right.\u201d \u201cThe stock market is, in a sense, crashing. The numbers are very bad. This is Bidenomics. It\u2019s catching up with him.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\u201d March 9, 2025, in a taped interview on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\" March 4, 2025, in a joint address to Congress In response to a question about whether his tariffs caused the turmoil in the markets, Trump said: \u201cBiden gave us a horrible economy. He gave us horrible inflation. And I think the market was going to go very, very bad. If anything, I have a lot of very smart people, friends of mine, and great businessmen. They're not investing because of what I've done.\u201d Trump, in comments directed at House Speaker Mike Johnson, then said: \u201cMr. Speaker, I think it\u2019s important, maybe you should pass a bill, you have to start my term from Nov. 5, OK, or Nov. 6, if you want. Nov. 5 because the market has gone through the roof. Enthusiasm has doubled.\u201d \u201cDow Jones UP 742 based on the fact that the Market expects a TRUMP WIN in November!

Tariffs will make our country rich,\" Trump responded. \u201cIf Harris wins this election, the result will be a Kamala economic crash, a 1929-style depression. 1929. When I win the election, we will immediately begin a brand new Trump economic boom. It\u2019ll be a boom. We\u2019re going to turn this country around so fast. Many people say that they only reason the stock market is up is because people think I am going to win.\u201d A look at some of Trump's observations on the stock market over the last year: Jan. 19, 2025. at a rally in Washington, D.C. Trump started praising Bessent and said: \u201cYou know what his theory is? The stock market is the only sign of life, and it\u2019s only going up because everyone thinks Trump is going to win the election. And others, too. Others, too. I\u2019m seeing it a lot. I think they\u2019re following your lead. But I appreciate that confidence.\u201d After a week of wild swings on Wall Street over uncertainty about his tariffs, Trump was asked whether he was expecting a recession in 2025. He said: \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d He added, \u201cIt takes a little time. It takes a little time.

In particular, HD Hyundai will develop optimised manufacturing processes to supply key Natrium reactor components. TerraPower is the first and only advanced nuclear developer with a permit application for a commercial advanced reactor submitted to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. That application was submitted in March 2024 and is on track for approval in December 2026. TerraPower is constructing the Natrium demonstration plant near a retiring coal facility at Kemmerer in Wyoming. A ground-breaking ceremony held in June last year marked the start of non-nuclear construction at the site. Nuclear construction will begin after the application is approved: the company is eyeing the start of work on the nuclear island in 2026. This partnership builds upon the relationship established in 2024 when HD Hyundai Heavy Industries was competitively selected by TerraPower to develop the cylindrical reactor vessel to be installed in the first Natrium reactor. Won added: \"We expect that HD Hyundai's extensive experience and advanced technological capabilities in manufacturing will help build the foundation for commercialisation of Natrium reactors. Based on this cooperation, we will accelerate the commercialisation of next-generation nuclear energy solutions and create new growth opportunities in the global SMR market.\" TerraPower has announced a strategic collaboration with South Korean conglomerate HD Hyundai to expand the global manufacturing supply chain for Natrium small modular reactors, supporting the rapid commercialisation of the advanced nuclear technology. Natrium technology features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor using high-assay low-enriched uranium fuel, with a molten salt-based energy storage system that can boost the system's output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed. \"TerraPower is committed to delivering our first Natrium plant in the United States, as well as rapidly deploying additional units at competitive prices during the next decade in the US and around the world,\" said TerraPower's Levesque. \"The Natrium technology provides crucial baseload power plus gigawatt-scale energy storage; these plants will provide reliable and flexible power to address growing energy demand. HD Hyundai Heavy Industries' manufacturing capabilities are world-renowned, and I look forward to working with them to establish the commercial-scale production capacity that will be essential for successful deployment of multiple Natrium units globally.\" The agreement combines HD Hyundai's manufacturing expertise with TerraPower's cutting-edge reactor technology, and will build new supply chain capacity to enable large-scale production and global deployment of Natrium plants. The signing ceremony was attended by Chung Kisun, Executive Vice Chairman of HD Hyundai; Won Kwang-shik, Head of Marine Energy Business Division at HD Hyundai Heavy Industries; Bill Gates, founder and chairman of TerraPower; Chris Levesque, president and CEO of TerraPower; and other officials.", "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/us/yale-suspends-scholar-terrorism.html": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/ezines/2025/03/12/dow-reverses-gains-as-canada-eu-reveal-counter-tariffs": " \ud83d\ude80 One Stock Pick Could Change Everything in 2025What if one stock pick could define your success next year?

Contact us While Asian stocks typically track market movements in the United States, their declines \u201cmay be more contained\u201d, given that markets in this part of the world have not rallied as much as the US and have a smaller presence of high-growth stocks, said IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong. As tariffs will inevitably be bad news for the region\u2019s export-oriented economies, analysts said cautious sentiment will likely persist in Asian markets until a clearer picture emerges of the extent and severity of tariffs \u2013 both by the US and other countries in retaliation \u2013 that will be implemented. Mr Zane Aw, research analyst at Phillip Securities Research, said the latest sell-off could potentially be the \u201cend of the bull run\u201d on Wall Street given factors such as expensive valuations and recent sluggish economic data. For Singapore, Mr Aw noted that opportunities lie in certain sectors that are \u201cbetter sheltered from a trade war\u201d, such as construction, utilities and telecommunications.

SINGAPORE: Concerns over US tariffs have triggered volatility on Wall Street, but this does\u00a0not mean that Asia\u2019s stock markets will be in for a similarly rough ride, analysts said. Asian stock markets were not spared from a sell-off but seem to have steadied by Wednesday with a mixed picture of gains and losses. Citing Chinese and Hong Kong stocks as examples, he noted that Chinese policymakers have pledged robust fiscal stimulus and a commitment to boost domestic consumption at the recent Two Sessions meeting. \u201cTrade uncertainty is the main driver of market concerns but once we get more clarity, consumers and businesses may adjust, and the impact could be less severe than feared,\u201d said Mr Yeap.

Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Business Uncertainty surrounding US tariffs and potential retaliatory measures will continue to weigh on Asia's stock markets until more clarity emerges, analysts say. A mixed outlook is forming over US stocks. In addition, the expectation that Trump may be sensitive to declines in the stock market, known as the \u201cTrump put\u201d, is \u201cso far nowhere to be seen\u201d, he added.

In particular, Chinese tech stocks may present an \u201cattractive risk-reward proposition and buy-on-weakness opportunity\u201d on the back of China\u2019s advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, upward earnings revisions and relatively inexpensive valuations, said Mr Yeap. But the trio of local banks - DBS, OCBC and UOB - which have been investors\u2019 favourites, may no longer be as attractive given the high valuations that may limit upside potential. Wall Street started the week with a\u00a0rout that wiped out US$4 trillion in market value from the S&P 500.\u00a0The Nasdaq Composite saw its steepest one-day decline since 2022, hit hard by technology-related stocks struggling with high valuations. Mr Yeap is more optimistic, noting that if global trade tensions were to escalate, the banks may continue to benefit from wealth inflows, given the country\u2019s status as a safe haven. The \u201cback and forth over tariffs is already having an initial negative economic impact\u201d, but this is not yet reflected in corporate profits, which are expected to grow 13 per cent this year, said the bank\u2019s chief investment officer Felix Brill.

However, a\u00a025 per cent tariff\u00a0on all US steel and aluminum imports will still take effect on Wednesday. \u201cThese will aid to counter a potential drop off in tariff-sensitive exports from the ongoing trade war,\u201d Mr Aw said.

A day later, Russian forces could be seen posing in the town, holding the flags of the Russian Federation and the Wagner Group. Live reporting by Adam McGroarty \"Despite the extremely difficult bilateral relations caused by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and long-running campaign of hostile action against the UK, the UK Government believes that maintaining diplomatic channels of communication, and our respective diplomatic missions, is important. Donald Trump is hosting Ireland's prime minister at the White House - and with the world's media assembled he isn't missing out on a chance to discuss key issues. Four people were killed in the strike which also damaged a grain vessel. \"It demonstrates how close this war is to Algeria, Syria and other countries,\" Andrii Sybiha said in a post on social media site X. Security and defence analyst Michael Clarke\u00a0is with us from 2pm to shed some light on the latest developments. \"Both sides have an incentive, a tactical incentive to do that,\" Clarke continues. You can also watch the discussion back in the YouTube video below. That is something US senator Lindsey Graham says he remains \"extremely sceptical\" about. More to bring you now from a Russian missile attack yesterday on the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukraine's foreign minister has described the strike as an attack on global food security and maritime safety. The US president also says \"we have people going to Russia right now\" - following reports his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Moscow this week. He says the US has received \"some positive messages\" after its proposal of a ceasefire at talks with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia yesterday. Trump's top diplomat Marco Rubio has urged Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day ceasefire - after the Kremlin said it was studying the proposal but would not agree to anything until it had heard from the US. Follow the latest here. The map below shows the locations of Russian troops in and around Sudzha that Sky News has verified. The orange dots show Russian troops and advances, and the grey dots show the former positions of Ukrainian troops. Why would Russia agree to a ceasefire now? Our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke has just finished answering your questions, including: We're just receiving pictures showing the defence ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK meeting in Paris. The Russians think they're doing well on the battlefield, he adds, and are\u00a0making progress in the Kursk region (see our 8am post). You can scroll back through his answers in the live page below. Videos geolocated by Sky News show Russian forces swiftly advancing on the key town of Sudzha on its southern border. As we've been reporting this morning, US-Ukraine talks have brought about a proposal for a temporary ceasefire in the war, and it's now in Russia's hands. \"But the incentive for the Ukrainians is greater than the incentive for the Russians.\" He also added the vessel was due to deliver wheat to Algeria. He says \"it is clear\" Volodymyr Zelenskyy is willing to make peace, and repeated Marco Rubio's statement that the ball is now in Russia's court. \"Hopefully we can get a ceasefire,\" he tells reporters, adding \"it is up to Russia now\". \"If they do not pursue the ceasefire with the same vigour as Ukraine, there will be hell to pay,\" he adds. Sudzha is situated just north of the border to Ukraine in Kursk and had a pre-invasion population of more than 5,000 people. It says it is clear that Russia is trying to drive the British embassy in Moscow towards closure, and adds it is revoking accreditation for a Russian diplomat and diplomatic spouse. \"The Russians would rather carry on, the Ukrainians would rather get a pause,\" Clarke says. Away from the White House, the UK has summoned its Russian ambassador. We'll be monitoring developments from the meeting and will bring you updates on this live page. Security and defence analyst Michael Clarke\u00a0has been answering your questions on the war in Ukraine in the past half hour. Since the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire was raised in talks with Ukrainian officials yesterday, the big question on the lips of analysts has been whether Russia would accept the plans. They are holding virtual discussions with Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov over aid for his country, with a follow-up meeting to be held on building European defence capabilities. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"We do not take this decision lightly, but we have always made clear to Russia that if they escalate, we will take reciprocal action. The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength. But both sides \"could do with a rest\" and \"both sides would use any time... to reorganise themselves and restock as far as they can\". \"Zelenskyy has passed the test of wanting peace. It is now up to Putin to show his cards,\" Graham says. Now, in a matter of days, Russian forces have reclaimed the centre of the town. More now on the situation in Kursk - which we've been reporting on throughout the day. On 11 March, footage showed large groups of Ukrainian troops pulling back from the centre of Sudzha on foot. You can catch up on the link in our post below - but here is one of the key questions he answered. That comes after the Kremlin said it will not decide on the US-proposed ceasefire until it hears from the Americans (see 9.49am post). Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It comes in response to Russia expelling a British diplomat and their spouse earlier this week. 'The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength' Ukraine took control of Sudzha during the Kursk offensive in August 2024 in just under two weeks. Initially named as Trump's Middle East envoy shortly after the US election, Steve Witkoff has since been involved in negotiations with Russia about ending the war in Ukraine. In short - a ceasefire now is \"of more tactical use to the Ukrainians than it is to the Russians\", he says. Wednesday 12 March 2025 17:24, UK His surprise trip to Moscow last month to achieve the release of US citizen Marc Fogel seemed to secure the 67-year-old as the US leader's geopolitical dealmaker-in-chief. \"We have drawn a line under this incident and demand Russia do the same. Any further action taken by Russia will be considered an escalation and responded to accordingly.\" But Trump also had a warning for Russia, saying \"there are things you could do in a financial sense that would be very bad for Russia\". While sitting in front of the cameras in the Oval Office, Donald Trump said \"we have people going to Russia right now\" - but only one man has been trusted to head up Donald Trump's envoy to Moscow, and he's far from the typical diplomat.", "https://www.aol.com/finance/wall-streets-hopes-2025-ipo-080024776.html": "However, Lynch of EquityZen expects that valuable startups considering their next move are content to grow in the private markets while they \"wait out the volatility.\" \u201cRight now, our outlook is a little bit negative,\u201d Avery Marquez, a portfolio manager for IPO-focused ETF provider Renaissance Capital, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a little bit more caution than we did at the beginning of the year, but I think we're very heartened by the fact that we're still seeing companies filing.\u201d The good news for Wall Street is that, so far this year, the total value of US IPOs is up 62%, according to Dealogic, hitting $10 billion as of March 11. The number of deals has nearly doubled, to 63 from 33 during the same period in 2024. But those plans could change if the stock market\u2019s recent whipsaw movements persist. Customer service software provider Gensys has already postponed its plans to go public in April or May, according to a report from the Information. Advertisement It filed for an IPO in late February and aims to raise about $4 billion at an expected target valuation of more than $35 billion, according to a Bloomberg report. Some companies that have tested the public markets so far this year have experienced setbacks. One is Venture Global Inc. (VG), a liquefied natural gas exporter that watched its stock fall roughly 60% since a January listing. Goldman CEO David Solomon told Fox Business on Wednesday that he still expects IPOs to rise this year. \u201cNormally, when you have a sell-off like the one that we've been having, in addition to just volatility and macro uncertainty, you're seeing headlines of companies pumping the brakes, killing their IPO plan,\u201d he said. Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance \"There were a lot of big expectations for the first quarter,\u201d said David Konrad, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst who covers money center and investment banks. But now, he said, \u201cit's very difficult to price an IPO when we're getting these swings in the market.\u201d At the beginning of the year, bankers were wildly optimistic that the Trump administration\u2019s pro-growth agenda and deregulatory stance would unleash the market\u2019s animal spirits and spur a flurry of US deals handled by big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Companies like CoreWeave seeking to go public are weighing their recent concerns of market volatility against how quickly their private capital and insider demands for payouts need to be replenished, according to Renaissance\u2019s Marquez. But \"that just isn't the case right now,\" Marquez added. But those results are still well short of 2021, the last boom year for dealmaking. The value of 2025's IPO deals so far is on track to underperform the average year of the past decade, while the number of deals so far is higher. \"I think a lot of investors are hoping a Big Tech company like CoreWeave could be the one to reverse that trend because, certainly, we aren't seeing strong IPO traction yet.\" David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance. AOL Hopes for an IPO bonanza in the first year of the new Trump era are being put to the test. Several tech companies \u2014 including Al cloud provider CoreWeave and the buy now, pay later app Klarna \u2014 are setting out to go public sometime over the second quarter. \"There is potential, especially if we got more specific actions on the regulatory front, to unleash more animal spirits,\" he said. One challenge ahead for a CoreWeave IPO is that investors are beginning to reset the big bets they\u2019ve made on the future of AI growth. A major IPO to watch in the coming weeks or months is CoreWeave, a startup that provides data center infrastructure to the likes of Microsoft and Nvidia. It is proving to be integral to the booming needs created by tech companies' artificial intelligence efforts. For premium support please call: \"It's questionable when these IPOs might happen,\" she added. \"The early IPOs that we have seen ... haven't really given a vote of confidence for other companies to follow,\" Brianne Lynch, EquityZen head of market insight, told Yahoo Finance, citing the example of Venture Global. Nvidia is both a big backer and client to the company. So is ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This week, CoreWeave struck a $11.9 billion contract with OpenAI that included CoreWeave\u2019s services, along with a private stake in the company. CoreWeave\u2019s IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, along with 11 other advisers. But the uncertainty surrounding the administration\u2019s trade policies is roiling markets and raising new concerns about the direction of the US economy and inflation, likely making it tougher for bankers and executives to pull the trigger on a public listing.", "https://tass.com/pressreview/1926457": " According to military analyst Alexey Leonkov, Ukraine was only able to carry out this large-scale assault due to Western-supplied technical resources. TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews \"Kiev seeks to engage with Moscow solely from a position of strength. Moreover, Zelensky himself is not prepared for constructive dialogue. If Ukraine refuses to accept Russia\u2019s terms, there is no alternative but for the special military operation to continue,\" he said. Market sentiment has also been dampened by concerns over a potential government shutdown and fears that the administration\u2019s aggressive trade, economic, and immigration policies could negatively impact the US economy, said Natalia Malykh, head of equity analysis at Finam to the newspaper. Kiev\u2019s provocation is largely driven by the stalled negotiations with Washington over resource agreements, as the US has been pressuring Ukraine to accept tighter commitments in the peace process, associate professor of political theory at MGIMO Ivan Loshkarev told Izvestia. At the opening of the trading session on March 11, key US stock indices continued their declines from the previous day, following Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on the economic transition period. By Tuesday evening (Moscow time), the S&P 500 had dropped by 0.44%, while the Dow Jones fell 0.9%. The NASDAQ 100 made a modest attempt at recovery, rising by 0.1%. However, the previous trading session saw the technology index suffer its worst day since 2022, shedding 3.8% in value and losing $1 trillion in market capitalization, Vedomosti writes. The most extensive Ukrainian drone assault on Russian territory to date was deliberately timed to coincide with upcoming US-Ukrainian negotiations, the Russian Defense Ministry reported. The Ukrainian Armed Forces sought to showcase their ability to sustain military operations. In total, Russian forces detected and intercepted 343 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including nearly a hundred targeting the capital. The attack resulted in the deaths of three individuals in Domodedovo. Meanwhile, OSCE Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu, during his visit to Moscow, assessed the damage to a residential building in the Moscow Region, following a UAV strike. Experts told Izvestia that the assault will have no impact on Russia\u2019s negotiating stance. He further noted that Ukraine had been stockpiling UAVs for some time in preparation for such an attack, whereas Russian forces conduct similar operations almost daily. Belova told the newspaper that Europe is unlikely to address its increased gas requirements by resuming pipeline imports from Russia. However, Chinese companies could play a role in redirecting LNG to the continent. According to the document, published on al-Sharaa\u2019s X account, all border checkpoints with Iran and Turkey, as well as airports, oil fields, and prisons currently under SDF control, will be transferred to the Syrian government by the end of the year. In return, Syrian Kurds will be granted \"constitutional rights,\" including the ability to use and teach their language and the opportunity for displaced individuals to return to their homes. The agreement also guarantees Kurdish participation in Syria\u2019s political process, regardless of religious affiliation. Meanwhile, the SDF has committed to supporting Damascus in its fight against Assad loyalists and other forces threatening the security and unity of the country. On March 11, Trump directed the Commerce Department to impose an additional 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum from Canada in response to Ontario\u2019s newly introduced electricity levies. Previously, the administration had imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, while also doubling tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%. The US government has further signaled its intent to introduce tariffs on EU imports and implement reciprocal tariffs against nations whose duties on American products exceed those levied by the US. Late in the evening of March 10, Syria\u2019s transitional authorities reached an agreement with the Kurdish administration governing northeastern Syria on integrating all civilian and military structures under pan-Syrian state institutions. The agreement was signed by Ahmed al-Sharaa, interim Syrian president and leader of the Ha\u2019yat Tahrir al-Sham group (an organization designated as terrorist and banned in Russia), along with Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). According to Vedomosti, the deal was reached under US pressure and will end with the withdrawal of their troops. Although current gas reserves in European UGS facilities have not yet reached historic lows - being approximately 12 bln cubic meters higher than at this time in 2022 - the circumstances today are significantly different. Two years ago, the EU was still receiving pipeline gas from Russia, with supplies only interrupted via the Yamal-Europe pipeline through Poland. Another major challenge concerns Ukrainian underground gas storage. Previously, Russian gas flowed through Ukraine, allowing for efficient replenishment. Now, with transit suspended and domestic production insufficient to meet demand, refilling these reserves will fall largely to EU member states. \"The discussion surrounding Starlink is mere doublespeak - no one is actually disabling it. A strike at this range would require satellite coordination,\" he said. \"This will be confirmed when Starlink routers are found among the remains of downed UAVs, as they were likely used to guide the drones to their targets. Evidently, this was designed as a large-scale, coordinated assault,\" he noted, adding that Russia\u2019s air defenses have markedly improved - had such an attack occurred a year ago, it would have posed a far greater threat. Following the discussions in Jeddah, it was revealed that Zelensky is once again expected at the White House. Furthermore, agreements were reached to accelerate negotiations on rare earth metals. During the negotiations, Western media reported that Washington explicitly ruled out Kiev\u2019s return to the borders of either 2014 or 2022. The Ukrainian side, however, swiftly dismissed these claims as \"disinformation.\" Nevertheless, one reality remains evident - the US has gradually adjusted its strategic approach from an unyielding commitment to Ukrainian victory to the pursuit of intermediary solutions, Izvestia writes. At the same time, despite US support and control over oil resources, Syrian Kurds face persistent pressure from Turkey, which has forced them to engage in dialogue with Damascus, the expert added. Yet, it becomes increasingly apparent that Ukraine remains unwilling to make substantive compromises or territorial concessions, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences Konstantin Blokhin told the newspaper. Beyond cost concerns, Europe also faces the risk of supply shortages in the event of adverse weather conditions, as LNG production in the United States cannot be expanded instantaneously. Securing additional gas supplies will require two possible solutions: diverting LNG shipments from the Asia-Pacific region (particularly China), as was the case three years ago, or reactivating one of the dormant Russian gas import routes. Ultimately, he concluded, this represents a last-ditch maneuver. From a military standpoint, Kiev is no longer capable of launching large-scale offensives and is instead restricted to conducting localized operations. Despite Ukraine\u2019s direct acts of aggression, Washington not only disregarded them but also announced the immediate resumption of military aid to Kiev. Meanwhile, Donald Trump revealed his intent to engage in direct talks with Vladimir Putin, with negotiations between Russia and the United States scheduled for March 11 or 12. Additionally, the US State Department confirmed that Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to visit Moscow on March 13. In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry acknowledged that interactions with US representatives could take place in the coming days. Vladimir Bruter, expert at the International Institute for Humanitarian and Political Studies, believes that Washington is attempting to impose an unfavorable framework upon Russia, having unilaterally announced agreements with Ukraine that were never coordinated with Moscow. Uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s foreign trade policy in terms of new tariffs or adjustments to existing ones has alarmed investors, leading to widespread sell-offs and profit-taking, stock market expert at BCS World of Investments Denis Buivolov noted. Moreover, fears of rising inflation due to increased tariffs have resurfaced, raising concerns that the Federal Reserve may delay its anticipated interest rate cuts, he added. As of March 11, natural gas reserves in the European Union\u2019s underground storage (UGS) facilities had dropped to 40 bln cubic meters, representing 36.67% of full capacity. Ahead of the autumn heating season, it will be essential to replenish these reserves while also refilling Ukraine\u2019s UGS facilities, which were nearly depleted last winter. The demand for gas in Europe will be further bolstered by the United Kingdom, which, lacking extensive storage capacity, will require an additional 2-3 bln cubic meters beyond its operational consumption, Rossiyskaya Gazeta writes. Washington has a strategic interest in legitimizing Kurdish autonomous institutions within Syria, as this would enable the US to exert influence over both Damascus and neighboring Turkey, chief researcher at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies Vladimir Vasiliev told Vedomosti. He believes that, in an effort to minimize costs, the United States will likely withdraw its military forces from Syria in the near future, delegating the responsibility of protecting US interests to Kurdish armed groups. The escalating trade wars under the Trump administration heighten the risk of a recession for the US economy, prompting investors to seek safer assets, senior portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital Ilya Golubov told Vedomosti. As a result, capital has shifted toward US Treasury bonds and gold, he added. According to Igor Istomin, Acting Head of the Department of Applied Analysis of International Processes at MGIMO, Ukraine has seemingly given in to US demands regarding the terms of a temporary ceasefire, following an unsuccessful meeting in the Oval Office. The United States has stated that Ukraine is prepared to settle the conflict and has agreed to an immediate 30-day ceasefire - not only in the air and at sea, as originally proposed by Kiev, but also on land - pending Moscow\u2019s approval. This was reported by members of the US delegation following the March 11 meeting in Jeddah. However, Kiev\u2019s professed willingness to de-escalate is contradicted by the most large-scale UAV attack on Moscow to date, which resulted in three fatalities. This development, according to Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Konstantin Kosachev, demonstrates that Ukraine is neither prepared for a genuine ceasefire nor for peace. Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador Rodion Miroshnik further stated that the Zelensky administration remains committed to prolonging hostilities. MOSCOW, March 12. /TASS/. The US says Ukraine is ready to settle the conflict and has agreed to an immediate 30-day ceasefire following the March 11 meeting in Jeddah; Russia thwarts the largest Ukrainian drone attack on its territory; and the US stock market declines on concerns about an economic slowdown. These stories topped Wednesday\u2019s newspaper headlines across Russia. Sergey Kaufman, analyst at Finam, supports this assessment, estimating that the EU will require roughly 30 bln cubic meters more than last year. \"However, Ukraine\u2019s willingness to pursue a settlement with US backing could serve as a mechanism to exert pressure on Russia, compelling it to respond and make key decisions. Trump likely expects that Moscow may alter its stance and agree to a phased resolution - first implementing a temporary ceasefire, followed by a comprehensive agreement,\" Istomin told Izvestia. At this stage, the agreements remain preliminary and the success of the Kurdish integration process into Syria\u2019s military and political structures will depend on both internal and external regional dynamics, Associate Professor at the Department of Foreign Regional Studies at Moscow State Linguistic University Iqbal Durre told the newspaper. Ideally, the Kurds would prefer to retain their autonomous political institutions and maintain independent armed forces within the Syrian army, but Damascus remains unwilling to yield on these points. These matters will undoubtedly be the subject of intense negotiations, Durre added. Research Director at Implementa Maria Belova outlined a baseline scenario assuming moderate spring temperatures. Under these conditions, EU gas reserves are projected to shrink to 25-30% by the end of the heating season. To meet the mandated 90% storage level, Europe will need to inject approximately 60 bln cubic meters of gas into its UGS facilities by October, which is more than twice the volume stored in preparation for the previous winter. However, Deputy Head of the National Energy Security Fund Alexey Grivach warns that the situation may be even more complex. By November, European companies will need to obtain 65-70 bln cubic meters of gas - double the amount added last summer - alongside an additional 8-10 bln cubic meters for Ukrainian storage. Exacerbating these difficulties are uncertainties surrounding summer weather conditions and Europe\u2019s fluctuating gas demand. With Ukrainian transit no longer contributing to supply balances, the EU will likely need to source an estimated 60 bln cubic meters of additional imports, primarily from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. \"Ukraine is deliberately seeking to sabotage the negotiation process while avoiding direct responsibility. The objective is to provoke Russia into responding in a manner that Washington could frame as excessive,\" Loshkarev explained. \"There is little military justification for this strike. It is more of a political maneuver, strategically timed to coincide with key international developments,\" he said. \"The nighttime assault was likely intended to signal that Ukraine still has the capability for an air campaign, thereby creating leverage in negotiations. However, this does not serve our interests, as Russia maintains undisputed air superiority,\" the expert added. The country\u2019s air defense systems functioned as expected during the raid, effectively neutralizing airborne threats, retired lieutenant colonel and chairman of the board of the all-Russian organization Officers of Russia Roman Shkurlatov told Izvestia."}, "summary_completions": [[{"article_number": "ARTICLE 19", "article_url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14487361/trump-biographer-explosive-predicition-economy-tariff-chaos.html", "impact_on_term_of_interest": "A biographer of Donald Trump warns that his tariff policies will have a devastating effect on the US economy, potentially leading to a recession as early as summer 2025.
