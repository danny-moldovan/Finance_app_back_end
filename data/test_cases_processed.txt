Reining in decades-high inflation was expected to be a slow and bumpy process. And readings have been a little choppy in recent months, prompting the central bank to take a more cautious approach to rate cuts in 2025. A receipt was sent to your email. However, the underlying trends and ongoing disinflationary progress seen in sticky areas like services, particularly shelter, could help to offset some of the tariff-driven increases on the goods side of the equation, she said. Despite some of the recent undulations, economists \u2014 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell \u2014 have noted that the underlying data continues to show that the pace of price hikes is slowing. Invalid password or account does not exist \u201cConsumers should prepare for significant increases in the cost of essential groceries, including eggs, baked goods and other groceries,\u201d Sohn said. \u201cSupply constraints, coupled with additional costs from tariffs, will push food prices higher and are expected to continue doing so in the coming months.\u201d Secure & Encrypted Have the latest local news delivered every afternoon so you don't miss out on updates.

The Dow gained 140 points, or 0.3%, before dropping by around 300 points. The S&P 500 rose by 1.1% in early morning trading and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.9% higher, though both later pared those gains. Egg prices, which have soared because an ongoing bout of avian flu is ravaging the industry, rose 10.4% for the month, a cooler reading than the 15.2% increase logged in January. Still, egg prices remain high, up 58.8% from a year ago. The steel and aluminum tariffs as well as additional tariffs levied on Canada and Mexico are expected to drive up the prices of new and used vehicles. The impact is likely to be more pronounced in the March CPI data, Sohn noted. Food and fuel are two of the most frequent ways that consumers encounter inflation, and those prices can fluctuate wildly on a month-by-month basis. That\u2019s due to factors such as weather, war, disease, supply chain snarls, spikes in demand or other temporary shocks.

One of the key contributors is the impact of tariffs, which have started to influence consumer prices.\u201d February\u2019s core CPI came in better than expected as well, rising 0.2% for the month (from 0.4% in January) and slowing to 3.1% annually from 3.2%.

Updated: March 12, 2025 @ 11:00 am Plus, a good chunk of the CPI is a very lagged indicator of what\u2019s happening in critical parts of the economy. The tariff policy has been frenetic, making it challenging for consumers, businesses and economists to truly gauge potential impacts. As it stands now, Wells Fargo economists expect the headline CPI to increase to 3.2% by the third quarter. BLS\u2019 measurement of housing-related prices is a very lagged and amorphous process (including estimating the rental value of owner-occupied homes). But in recent months, the shelter index has better reflected the slower, if not flat or falling, rent hikes seen in real life. \u201cFamiliar problem areas,\u201d such as high, but slowing, housing-related inflation, continue to exert pressure on household budgets, noted Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. Thank you. Eggs represent a small share of the overall Consumer Price Index, at 0.15%, but they can have an outsized impact with a large increase. \u201cMy colleague Sarah House has a good phrase on this: \u2018Inflation is a process,\u2019\u201d Cervi said. \u201cA lot of it is reflecting past business decisions and how that\u2019s being reflected in prices.\u201d The Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes across commonly purchased goods and services, was 2.8% for the 12 months ended in February, a cooldown from the 3% annual rate notched in January, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2%, versus 0.5% in January. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a delta, probably closer to a percentage point higher of where we would be in the absence of all of this tariff policy,\u201d Nicole Cervi, Wells Fargo economist, told CNN in an interview. The-CNN-Wire \u201cThe moderation that we\u2019re seeing in shelter, a lot of that is reflecting rental price deceleration that we saw last year, even toward the end of 2023,\u201d she said. (CNN) \u2014 Inflation slowed more than expected in February and cooled for the first time in five months, but that progress may be short lived as President Donald Trump ramps up his trade war, which threatens to increase prices for Americans. A 10% tariff imposed on Chinese goods went into effect in February, and some retailers likely raised prices preemptively, Sohn noted.

Some foreign investors may repatriate their money home and in time, a new global reserve currency could emerge alongside the dollar, they wrote. The dollar's weakness amid the ongoing stock market rout has led to speculation that the greenback is \"losing its haven status permanently, as the US relinquishes its traditional role in guaranteeing global security,\" wrote Thierry Wizman, a global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie, on Wednesday. But much of the dollar's decline in the past week is due to a rise in the euro after Germany and Europe's plans for massive defense and government spending, Wizman added. To be sure, analysts still largely agree that King Dollar is the world's reserve currency. The greenback's role as the world's reserve currency has been under discussion in recent years on concerns including the use of the US-dominant global financial system in sanctions and now, Trump 2.0. He wrote that the euro and yen are the \"obvious candidates\" to become reserve currencies. The US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was 0.3% lower at 103.56 at 4:33 a.m. ET on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the index hit a low not seen since October 16. It's down 5% since January 20, when Trump took office. While developments outside the US have pushed major currencies higher, the greenback's weakness is unusual. The haven currency typically gains in uncertain market conditions. Commodities \"It would have sounded fanciful only a month ago, but after Europe's fiscal paradigm shift, perhaps it could be the euro,\" Nomura analysts wrote. Stocks The euro is trading around 1.09 against the dollar. If it soars well above 1.11 against the dollar and stays at the level this year, this may indicate that global reserve managers are reallocating away from the dollar, according to Macquarie's Wizman. Indices \"Given growing distrust over US management of America's economic and geopolitical foundations, investors may begin to search more intently for possible other dollar alternatives or workarounds,\" Kamin and Sobel wrote. This development \u2014 as well as the potential end of the war in Ukraine \u2014 has sent the euro up. On Wednesday, the currency hovered close to a five-month peak against the dollar. Trump has said he wants to see a weaker dollar, which he thinks would help exports. He has also pledged to keep the greenback the world's dominant currency and threatened a 100% tariff on countries that give up the dollar. Wizman isn't the only analyst raising the prospect recently as Trump's America First policy reverberates across the world. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen \u2014 long a haven currency \u2014 has also gained about 5% against the dollar since Trump's inauguration, in part due to the Bank of Japan's signal to raise interest rates. The US dollar neared a five-month low against other major currencies on Wednesday after President Donald Trump's economic and trade policies drove another wild day in the markets. \"We are not ready to say that the USD has lost its reserve currency status significantly, but the risk is certainly tilted toward that proposition,\" wrote Wizman. The policy is causing knock-on effects on other economies including Europe and China. They are ramping up policy stimulus to support growth, which would make assets in these regions more attractive, particularly if the US slips into a recession. Two think tank researchers wrote on Monday that Trump is undermining the dollar's role in global financing and as a reserve currency. \"The world is openly questioning whether the US is a reliable partner,\" wrote Steven Kamin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and Mark Sobel, the US chair of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.

But after campaigning on lowering prices on day one, in recent weeks \u2014 including during his address to Congress last week \u2014 he has warned the country to get ready for a \"little disturbance\" from potential trade wars. Are we heading for a recession? Last week, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u00a0posted preliminary economic data\u00a0showing a drop of 2.4 percent for the GDP in the first quarter of 2025, the first time we've seen a quarterly drop since 2022 during the pandemic. (This story was updated with new information.) While Trump and his advisers have been steadfast in promising it will all lead to a stronger economy, these moves can have devastating effects on the economy, along with consumer and investor confidence. The slide continued Tuesday after Trump escalated his trade war with Canada by pledging to double his planned steel and aluminum tariffs after the province of Ontario\u00a0said it would charge\u00a0U.S. customers more for electricity in retaliation for Trump's previous tariff threats. \u201cThere isn\u2019t necessarily a reason to be extremely concerned about an imminent recession, because we\u2019re coming out of two very strong years of growth,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY Parthenon, told CNN Monday, \u201can environment where income growth was strong, where productivity growth was strong, where consumer spending growth is strong and, really, where the economy overall was quite strong.\u201d \u201cAll I know is this: We\u2019re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we\u2019re going to become so rich, you\u2019re not going to know where to spend all that money. I\u2019m telling you, you just watch. We\u2019re going to have jobs. We\u2019re going to have open factories. It\u2019s going to be great.\u201d Trump has dismissed concerns over the stock market tumble of the last week. The definition is a little fuzzy, and recessions are often not declared until they've already been going on for some time. But uncertainty about what tariffs will do is causing the stock market to be more volatile than usual, which also affects anyone with a 401(k) retirement plan. But those indicators can get into the weeds and become very technical. An unofficial definition of a recession many experts use as a rule of thumb is when the gross national product (GDP) drops two financial quarters in a row. The hardest part of a recession is uncertainty about your financial situation, now and in the future. Investopedia.com suggests the following tips to get through a recession: In just over one month in office, the Trump administration has fired great swaths of federal workers around the country, cut billions in funding to U.S. aid programs and scientific research programs, and threatened unpredictable on-again-off-again tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China that will raise prices for Americans, especially on groceries. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a recession in the U.S. is \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\u201d The nonprofit bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official designator of business cycles. Countries that have had tariffs imposed on them also may choose to retaliate with tariffs on American goods and services, further harming American businesses. Indications of a recession often include: To be a recession, the economic situation has to hit three criteria \u2014 depth, diffusion, and duration \u2014 but extreme conditions in one can offset weaker conditions in another. The committee looks at: \u201cFor consumers, tariffs are like another form of inflation, just spelled differently,\u201d said Darpan Seth, CEO of Nextuple, which helps build and support programs to help its clients get products for consumers in stores or online. \u201cThey have the same effect of rising prices.\u201d A depression is far worse. A depression is a widespread, extreme recession that lasts longer and causes generational damage to the economy. The last one in the U.S., the Great Depression of the 1930s, saw the stock market crash, banks failing, and thousands of Americans out of work for over a decade. What does that mean? If the trend continues, a recession is possible. A country's GDP is the total market value of all the goods and services produced and rendered in a specific time period, and is often an indicator of the country's economic performance. The Federal Reserve isn't lowering interest rates yet, but economists believe there will be multiple reductions in June, July and October due to a slowed economy from Trump's trade, fiscal, immigration and regulatory policies. There is also concern Social Security is on the chopping block, with the world's richest man and presidential adviser Elon Musk calling it a \"Ponzi scheme\" and Trump claiming unsubstantiated \"shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud.\" With rumored cuts coming to Medicare and Medicaid, Americans may start keeping the money they have left to themselves. A recession is a downward trend in the business cycle characterized by a decline in production, sales and employment. Recessions are common and can be very quick or last months or years. The U.S. saw drops after the collapse of the housing market in 2008 and during the first months of the pandemic shutdown in 2020, and the country recovered. But sometimes they spiral out of control and lead to a depression. On Monday, U.S. stocks plunged. The Dow dropped 890 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq and broad S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day drop in over two years, largely in response to President Donald Trump's interview released the day before on Fox's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" when he wouldn't say whether the United States might face a recession this year. That could mean it will be a great time to buy a house, but it may also come at a time of income instability to keep paying for it. That doesn't necessarily mean we're moving into a recession. There are other reasons the GDP might slip in an otherwise strong economy, such as earlier this year when consumers and companies were bringing in imports at a higher rate in anticipation of higher prices from Trump's threats of tariffs. \"I hate to predict things like that,\" he told Fox host Maria Bartiromo. \"There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big.\" When a reporter on Air Force One asked Trump Monday evening if he was worried about a recession, the president said, \"Who knows? Trump has repeatedly stated that the other countries would pay for the tariffs, although economists describe them as taxes on foreign imports that drive up prices at the register since affected companies pass any additional costs to the consumer.", "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/business/stock-markets-trading-tariffs.html": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4766907-waterdrop-inc-wdh-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript": "Conference Call Participants Tracy Li - Investor Relations Shen Peng - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Xu Xiaoying - Head-Finance Jasmine Li - Board Secretary Wei Ran - Director & General Manager-Insurance Business Good morning everyone.

And maybe this is an example of one of the reasons why, because as the economy slows, you would expect to see some of the price pressures come off and the economy is slowing.\" \"I don't expect that there's a need for (The Fed) to do anything in next meeting, but it will allow them to talk intelligently about what they will do in the remainder of this year. And I think it probably means that they're going to signal that, as they earlier forecasted, there will be a cut or two in interest rates sometime this year.\" PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK CHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTHLIGHT ASSET MANAGEMENT, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA (by email) (Compiled by the Global Finance & Markets Breaking News team) Advertisement BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN \"The tariff-battered markets are going to breathe a sigh of relief this morning, as higher inflation was the only thing that could make things worse. With a lower-than-expected inflation number (both month-over-month and year-over-year), at least the Fed still has the flexibility to step in to support a weaker economy, and that would be good news for markets, which have been through the ringer in the past month and a half. The consumer price index rose 0.2% last month after accelerating 0.5% in January, the Labor said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through February, the CPI increased 2.8% after climbing 3.0% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3% and advancing 2.9% year-on-year.

We\u2019re not even in the woods. This report will serve as the baseline for seeing how much tariffs are resulting in higher consumer prices. Good news on CPI could be bad news for profit margins of businesses. Someone pays the price of tariffs and the question is whether companies have the pricing power to push cost increases onto households.\" COMMENTS: \u201cThe February CPI release showed further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January\u2019s strong release. While the Fed is still likely to remain on hold at this month\u2019s meeting, the combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle.\u201d JEANETTE GARRETTY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ROBERTSON STEPHENS, SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA The first full inflation report of President Donald Trump's administration still left prices running at levels that economists say are inconsistent with the Federal Reserve's 2% target. \u201cDoes this move the needle for the Fed? I don't think so. At next week's FOMC meeting they'll probably talk about this. They'll probably say they feel comfortable that the inflation is headed in the right direction but will obviously talk about the unknown and that unknown is the effects of the tariffs.\u201d \u201cAnd you know, after such a long period of strong declines I think the market is going to have a relief rally here. After today\u2019s inflation data investors will probably take a rest in terms of worrying over the tariffs.\u201d \u201cThis is good news on the inflation front, but of obviously with the imposition of tariffs, we still don't know where the real direction of inflation is at this time, but based on month-to-month and year-to-year, it's moving in the right direction.\u201d (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in February, but the improvement is likely temporary against the backdrop of aggressive tariffs on imports that are expected to raise the costs of most goods in the months ahead.

Trump later met with about 100 chief executives of U.S. firms amid evidence that his trade policies could hurt the U.S. economy, threatening to dash a \"soft landing\" that until recently appeared as the base case and reignite inflation. Powered By White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Ford's initial comments were \"egregious and insulting\" and said Canada would be \"very wise not to shut off electricity for the American people.\" Trump was determined to ensure the U.S. relied on its own domestic electricity, she said. Faced with Trump's 50% tariff threat, Ford agreed to suspend the surcharge and meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington on Thursday. Trump's hyper-focus on tariffs since taking office in January has rattled investor, consumer and business confidence in ways that economists increasingly worry could cause a recession. A small business survey on Tuesday showed sentiment weakening for a third straight month, fully eroding a confidence boost following Trump's November 5 election victory, and a survey of households by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their finances, inflation and the job market. Investors are bracing for a further round of tariffs on autos as well as tit-for-tat reciprocal tariffs in early April. Canada and China have retaliated with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, while Mexico stopped short of retaliation after Trump delayed his planned levies on the southern U.S. neighbor. The metals tariffs will apply to millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and other countries that had been entering the U.S. on a duty-free basis under carve-outs. Trump has vowed that the tariffs will be applied \"without exceptions or exemptions\" in a move he hopes will aid the struggling U.S. industries. India's Largest Regional Retail Option Traders Summit. (BOTS) is a prestigious options trading event organized by Traders Gurukul. Held on the 2nd OR 3rd Sunday of every month, across top cities in India President Donald Trump reversed course on Tuesday afternoon on a pledge to double tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada to 50%, just hours after announcing the higher tariffs, in rapid-fire moves that scrambled financial markets. The switch came after a Canadian official also backed off his own plans for a 25% surcharge on electricity. The U.S. president shook off the market gyrations, telling reporters that markets would go up and down, but that he had to rebuild the economy.

Follow us on: Trump triggered the selloff with a morning post on his Truth Social media platform, saying he had instructed Lutnick to put an additional 25% tariff on the metals products from Canada that take effect on Wednesday, on top of the 25% on all imported steel and aluminum products from other countries.

On Monday, Carney said he could not speak with Trump until he was sworn in as prime minister. \"The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build ... The biggest win is not the tariffs. That's a big win. It's a lot of money. But the biggest win is they move into our country and produce jobs,\" he said, insisting the tariffs would \"be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\" Trump's latest salvo, which whipsawed financial markets and rekindled fears of inflation, followed Ontario Premier Doug Ford's announcement that he would place on the electricity Canada's most populous province supplies to more than 1 million U.S. homes unless Trump dropped all of his tariff threats against Canada's exports into the U.S. Trump's promise to double the metals levies on Canada sent some aluminum prices soaring.

Even before this year's economic uncertainty caused recessionary fears to spike, consumers were already signaling lower spending intentions in the first quarter. Meanwhile, disappointing earnings projections from Dick's pushed the athletic retailer's stock down almost 6% in Tuesday's session. Monday marked the index's most painful day this year \u2014 among notable losers were stocks exposed to consumer lending, such American Express, Capital One, and Discover. Both are just the latest examples in a string of downbeat consumer signals. Last month, retail stocks were rocked by Walmart's underwhelming fiscal year outlook, suggesting a looming spending unwind. The notion of a spending pullback has ripped into the stock market over recent weeks, adding to economic pressures that have pushed the benchmark S&P 500 index to drop 9.4% from a February high. Kohl's sank 23% by around midday on Tuesday. For the full year, the retailer expects net sales to drop 5%-7%. Earnings per share are forecast between $0.10-$0.60, well below consensus estimates. Airlines and retailers are the latest casualties of mounting calls for a weaker consumer as Wall Street positions for a possible economic slowdown. A growing number of firms are signaling a weaker outlook for US consumer spending, putting a key pillar of economic support in focus for investors this year. Disappointing outlooks from a range of companies show expectations for strong consumer spending have ebbed after years of US shoppers helping to prop up the post-pandemic economy. Jump to Delta, Southwest, and Jet Blue each cited macroeconomic uncertainty as a leading reason for lowered earnings forecasts this week. A weaker outlook for travel demand has slashed first-quarter revenue expectations. Delta fell as much as 8.7% Tuesday morning. While Americans' buying spree has been a source of economic and market strength since 2022, consumer endurance is petering out: stubborn inflation, high interest rates, and the threat of tariffs are pushing spenders into a cost-saving mentality.

In these cases, you might be better served by financial planning software with more advanced features, consulting with a financial advisor, or using free spreadsheet templates designed for budgeting. Would real-time spending insights and reminders help you make better financial decisions? Reputable budgeting apps typically employ secure encryption and follow privacy standards to protect financial data. Before signing up for any financial service, verify its security features and privacy policy. Users with debt from smaller lenders using less advanced technology may find that Stretch doesn\u2019t fully integrate with these institutions. Similarly, those managing finances across multiple countries will likely find the app insufficient for their needs, as Stretch isn\u2019t designed to handle international financial complexities. Stretch Financial Wellness is an app designed to help users manage their finances with a focus on debt management, real-time insights and guidance for making financial progress. Do you need guidance to develop better financial habits but don\u2019t want to hire a financial advisor? Is debt management (especially credit cards) a primary financial goal for you? Have basic budgeting apps failed to give you the structure and motivation you need? For premium support please call: The $12.99 monthly fee for the Vision subscription may be counterproductive for budget-conscious users, especially since the free version only supports one credit card. Considering the average American has 3.84 credit cards, many users would need to upgrade to the paid plan for full functionality. In behavioral economics, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cnudging\u201d \u2014 small, thoughtful prompts that help us make better decisions without being intrusive. Budgeting apps often claim to be that nudge, but not all of them deliver. Some simply log your spending after the fact, while others try to guide you toward smarter money habits in real time. Financial stress affects more than your bank account. According to the American Psychological Association, 63 percent of Americans cite money as a significant source of stress. This stress can impact mental health, daily functioning and even physical wellbeing. Do you prefer having all your accounts \u2014 loans, credit cards and savings \u2014 visible in one dashboard? Categorized spending insights: The app organizes spending into categories to help users understand spending patterns and make adjustments. If you answered yes to most of these questions, Stretch could be beneficial. However, consider alternative solutions if you have complex financial circumstances requiring personalized advice, manage finances across international borders, are already comfortable using spreadsheets or other low-cost alternatives, or find that the subscription cost doesn\u2019t fit your budget. Stretch offers a 7-day free trial, after which the Vision subscription costs $9.99 monthly for the first three months with promotional code SAVE3FOR3. Regular pricing is $12.99 monthly. Stretch does have notable advantages, including its user-friendly interface, emphasis on progress over perfection and the ability to make payments directly through the app. Unlike some competitors, it offers a free version, albeit with significant limitations.", "https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/trump-tariff-threats-present-opportunity-for-india-too-much-protection-detrimental-to-growth-shamika-ravi-12963010.html": " \u201cOur national champions have been the old folks.

President Trump imposed 10 per cent tariffs on all imports from China in February and raised the tariff subsequently to 20 per cent. China, she noted, has reduced its protectionist policies especially in the last few months. The opposition has been lashing out at the government on the negotiations as US President Donald Trump claimed that the Indian side has agreed to reduce tariffs. She said that India\u2019s tariff barriers could be hurting its competitiveness, adding that the country needs to re-focus on enabling manufacturing of world class products and not by protecting the domestic markets. Even as policymakers and trade negotiators try to navigate this political and economic landmine, there are constituencies to protect and political optics at stake. \u201cIn the last four months they have removed a lot of protectionist measures they had. If you look at the data over the past 5-6 years, in net we (India) have been liberalizing the markets. US, China and Germany are more protectionist in terms of the instruments and policies they have brought in the last five years But India in that sense is a bit like Japan. In net, we are liberalizing. Trade for us is one of the components that is feeding into growth,\u201d she added. A Citi research has estimated the potential losses to be around $7 billion annually with auto and agriculture being the most vulnerable. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh has questioned the government on whether the interest of Indian farmers and manufacturers is being compromised by reducing tariffs. While no official statement has been made, Dr Shamika Ravi, Member, Prime Minister\u2019s Advisory Council told Moneycontrol that the current situation is a window of opportunity. US President Donand Trump's April 2 deadline on reciprocal tariffs on India is nearing. However, the meaning of reciprocal tariffs continues to be unclear considering the trade profiles of both nations is very different. India\u2019s imports from the United States include mineral fuels and oils, pearls and stones, nuclear reactors, electrical machinery etc, while exports comprise textiles, marine products, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, electronics, among others. \u201cWe will have to bring in all measures to raise the competitiveness of our markets. Many sectors in our economy have enjoyed protection for some time. When you have seen protectionist measures in other markets - it\u2019s through export subsidies, targeted towards exports. Most of the other markets have protected trade by way of the state bearing the cost of either improvement in quality of the product, which means export or basic subsidies.\u00a0This has led to production of world class products. We have to do the same. At the moment the support we are giving is in the nature of creating barriers - so as to give protective markets. We are not targeting global markets through our trade policy,\u201d Ravi said. Why protectionism hurts \u201cI think the current situation is a window of opportunity to lower tariffs and see what are the reforms needed in trade for it to directly feed into growth,\u201d Ravi told Moneycontrol in an interview.

Some analysts say it\u2019s likely the nation will topple into a downturn if Trump moves ahead with all of the\u00a0tariffs\u00a0he has threatened on a broad range of imported goods. Washington state exported $57.8 billion worth of goods to the world in 2024, making it the ninth-largest state exporter\u00a0that year, according to the\u00a0Office of the United States Trade Representative, or USTR. The state's largest market was China, where it exported $12 billion worth of goods, followed by Canada ($7.9 billion), Japan ($5 billion), Mexico ($4.3 billion),\u00a0and South Korea ($3 billion). The gambit would sharply raise consumer prices and sap Americans' purchasing power while ratcheting up business uncertainty, experts say, curtailing investment and hiring. It wasn't all rosy, however. In December 2024, pending home sales in Washington were down 5.1% year-over-year, according to the OFM. It isn\u2019t \u2013 yet. That's mostly because American consumers are still in good financial shape, and the nation\u2019s businesses generally remain\u00a0optimistic\u00a0despite growing uncertainty about the trade conflicts and federal cuts, forecasters say. Trump has targeted China, Canada, and Mexico with tariffs and threats. There may be other signs of economic instability. U.S.-based employers announced plans in February to cut 172,017\u00a0jobs, the \"highest total for the month since 2009,\" according to global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. With the\u00a0stock market tumbling, consumer confidence skidding, and U.S. companies ramping up layoffs, it may look like the nation is hurtling toward a\u00a0recession\u00a0amid\u00a0President Donald Trump\u2019s widening global trade war and federal job cuts. The unemployment rate in Washington state was 4.5% in December 2024, according to the latest data reported by the state's Office of Financial Management. This represents a 0.3% year-over-year increase. Washington's nonfarm jobs rose by 40,000 monthly, a 1.1% increase from the previous year. But trouble spots are mounting. Economists are raising their inflation forecasts and downgrading their 2025 growth estimates. Here's what to know about the economic indicators of a recession and how Trump's policies might affect Washington state's economic outlook. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index fell 2.7% Monday, compounding last week\u2019s losses, and it\u2019s down 8.7% from its record high in mid-February. That\u2019s a big worry because the effects of wealth gains or losses on consumer spending are four times as large now as during the previous two economic cycles, economist Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics said. Cascade PBS reported a \"big uptick\" in federal workers applying for unemployment insurance in Washington state, as billionaire Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency pursues federal job cuts. Consumer spending declined 2% in January. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics traced some of the drop to severe winter weather but noted early retail sales indicators in February point to a further retreat. USA TODAY contributed to this report. The U.S. added 151,000 jobs in February, and the national unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, the Labor Department reported. Federal government employment declined, coinciding with the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce. Speaking to NPR's \"Morning Edition\" program on March 11, Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said Americans should focus on two pieces of data: employment growth and household spending. \"So I would say if the job market turns negative and we're laying off private and public sector workers, that's the key No. 1 criterion,\" Gapen said in the interview. \"After that, I'd say it's more about household spending. Personal consumption.\" Washington's economic outlook was largely positive, according to OFM's report, which was released in February. The monthly count of initial claims for unemployment insurance decreased by 1,900 in January 2025. In housing, 40,400 building permits were issued in December 2024, up by 4,500 from the previous year. The OFM also reported that the net percentage of lenders willing to make consumer loans was up 5.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2025. Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson previously said that retaliatory tariffs from Canada could impact \"at least $296 million in Washington agricultural exports.\" He added that Trump's tariffs would also raise living costs for Washington families and make the state's exports less competitive on the world stage. \u201cThe economy will likely suffer a downturn if the Trump administration follows through on the tariff increases it has announced and maintains those tariffs for more than a few months,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, posted on X on Monday. \"As of March 5, 952 federal employees have filed unemployment claims with Washington\u2019s Employment Security Department this year \u2013 about double the number of claims from the same time period last year, which saw 472 claims,\" the public media outlet reported, noting that most of the claims were filed after Trump took office. Goldman Sachs has bumped the chances of a slump from 15% to a still-modest 20%, but only because it still reckons the White House will pull back \u201cif the downside risks begin to look more serious.\" JPMorgan Chase figures there\u2019s a 40% chance of a downturn.", "https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/opinion/trump-recession.html": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is having difficulty keeping his government on an even keel.

Cryptocurrencies USD/CAD looks for an interim support near 1.4400 after the release of the US inflation data for February and the BoC\u2019s monetary policy decision. Cooling US inflation is expected to prompt Fed dovish bets. The BoC cut interest rates by 25 bps to 2.75%, as expected, and guided a dismal economic outlook. In terms of economic data, we should highlight the Trade Account Balance, a balance between exports and imports of total goods and services. A positive value shows trade surplus, while a negative value shows trade deficit. It is an event that generates some volatility for the USD/CAD. If a steady demand in exchange for CAD exports is seen, that would turn into a positive growth in the trade balance, and that should be positive for the CAD. The BoC is likewise set to continue easing interest rates through 2025, at least at a faster pace than the Fed is expected to, which will apply pressure on CAD\u2019s already-rising rate differential. The BoC is under significant pressure to continue lowering interest rates. The Canadian Dollar is poised to continue falling in the first quarter. However, CAD investors will be looking to reassess the state of play between the Fed and the BoC heading into the middle quarters of the year. Read more details about the forecast.

Everyone has a role to play in ensuring AI is used constructively and effectively,\u201d he added. They argue that proactive legislation will help mitigate risks while ensuring AI\u2019s responsible and ethical use in corporate governance. The call for early AI regulation was made during the 14th Annual Directors and Company Secretaries Conference, where governance professionals deliberated on AI\u2019s transformative impact on businesses and the urgent need for legal frameworks to safeguard society. Despite AI\u2019s growing influence, Langoya cautioned against fear-driven resistance, urging governance professionals to embrace AI rather than fight it. Beyond Uganda, AI regulation remains a pressing global issue. Patrick Courtney, head of Membership at the Chartered Governance Institute UK and Ireland, commended Ugandan professionals for addressing AI\u2019s governance challenges at such a critical moment. While AI is already widely adopted in various sectors globally, it remains largely unregulated, except for the recently enacted EU AI Act. The conference served as a platform for dialogue, bringing together stakeholders from the private sector, government agencies and NGOs to discuss how Uganda can leverage AI\u2019s benefits while addressing ethical dilemmas and regulatory gaps. Her sentiments were echoed by Peter Kyambadde, a partner at KPMG, who highlighted AI\u2019s increasing impact on Uganda\u2019s economic landscape. \u0394 Company secretaries in Uganda insist that the country must follow suit, given its growing reliance on AI technologies and a predominantly youthful population increasingly exposed to AI-driven innovations. As businesses and governments across the world race to catch up with AI advancements, Uganda faces a critical choice\u2014to regulate AI early and responsibly or risk playing catch-up in a future dominated by ungoverned artificial intelligence. \u201cAI is everywhere\u2014it\u2019s in our smartphones, computers and all the systems we use. The relevance and urgency of discussing this topic cannot be overstated. This conference is extremely timely,\u201d he observed. \u201cThe major threat is the ethical component. Today, you see a picture or video on WhatsApp, and you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s real or manipulated. AI can alter images and videos to create actions that are not genuine. This is a major concern,\u201d she stated. \u201cIt\u2019s about efficiency, but not at the cost of people and the environment. The government needs to enact an AI law that protects individuals and regulates the entire AI development chain, from innovators to end-users,\u201d she added.

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape industries worldwide, professional company secretaries in Uganda are calling for immediate government intervention to regulate the rapidly evolving technology.

But embracing these technologies successfully requires awareness of both the potential and the pitfalls. Actionable Advice: Design a phased integration strategy. Look for AI infrastructure that\u2019s modular and can work in tandem with legacy equipment, reducing the need for full system overhauls at once. For decades, the heartbeat of American industry seemed to weaken as U.S. manufacturing struggled against the low labor costs of overseas competitors. The resulting decline shuttered once-thriving industrial towns and created a pervasive sense of lost greatness. But in 2024, we\u2019re witnessing a profound shift: The U.S. manufacturing sector is experiencing a remarkable revival, fueled by advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and nano-sensor technology. Actionable Advice: Start small. Identify areas where automation can deliver quick, measurable benefits\u2014like quality control or predictive maintenance\u2014before scaling to more complex processes. However, leaders who rush into automation without acknowledging its inherent complexities may experience costly mistakes. Below are some of the most common hurdles companies face when integrating AI and nano-sensor technology into their facilities. AI-Driven Robotics: AI-powered automation is no longer a futuristic concept; it\u2019s a practical tool for reshaping production lines. Tesla\u2019s Gigafactories in Nevada and Texas showcase how advanced robotics can streamline assembly, reduce labor costs and increase throughput. This approach often yields lower defect rates and faster turnaround, enabling manufacturers to better compete against global rivals. The resurgence of U.S. manufacturing is real, but lasting success depends on more than just plugging in new machines. By marrying AI and nano-sensor technology with careful planning, robust data practices and workforce development, American industry can thrive again on the global stage. The Challenge: Highly interconnected AI systems can be a prime target for cyberattacks. If an automated production line is compromised, it can shut down entire facilities. The Challenge: Automation can displace some jobs but also creates demand for specialized skill sets\u2014such as AI programming, sensor calibration and robot maintenance. Balance human and AI expertise. While AI excels at pattern recognition and speed, human expertise remains critical for strategic planning, troubleshooting and nuanced decision-making. This renaissance signals not just a rebound but a revolution\u2014one where innovation bolsters production capabilities, revitalizes local economies and reestablishes the United States as a world leader in manufacturing. The path forward requires intention, strategy and respect for the complexity of automated systems. After all, even in a new era defined by robotics and AI, human insight remains the critical guiding force that turns potential into performance. Focus on incremental wins. Instead of leaping into full-scale automation, test AI and sensor technologies in targeted areas. Demonstrating ROI in a single plant or line can bolster buy-in across the company. Plan for economic uncertainty. Manufacturing is cyclical, and global supply chains are volatile. Maintain buffers in your budget for potential disruptions, and diversify supply chains to reduce risks. Actionable Advice: Implement robust cybersecurity measures, from real-time threat detection to end-to-end data encryption. Regular audits and employee training can also help mitigate vulnerabilities. Matthew Putman, co-founder and CEO of Nanotronics, an AI-driven manufacturing company serving top semiconductor manufacturers. The Challenge: AI systems, advanced robotics and nano-sensors require significant capital expenditure. Many factories also need retrofitting to accommodate high-tech equipment. ByMatthew Putman , Forbes Councils Member. Actionable Advice: Build comprehensive reskilling programs. Equip current employees with the training needed to operate and maintain AI-driven systems, ensuring they stay relevant in an evolving job market. Invest in continuous improvement. AI models require ongoing training and fine-tuning. Allocate resources for system updates and employee education to ensure your tech stack remains competitive. Yet while emerging technologies offer incredible opportunities, leaders must tread carefully. AI and nano-sensors can streamline operations and reduce costs, but they also come with steep upfront investments, integration challenges and workforce realities that can make or break a manufacturing resurgence. Below, I\u2019ll outline key considerations for executives looking to navigate this new industrial era strategically and sustainably. Actionable Advice: Establish rigorous data governance protocols. Ensure that data collection, storage and management processes are standardized and transparent across the organization. American manufacturing has a real opportunity to capture global market share by leveraging new technology responsibly and effectively. Here are a few strategic moves leaders should prioritize: Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? The Challenge: AI models are only as good as their data. Inconsistent data collection or lack of standardized processes can lead to poor decision-making. Nano-Sensor Precision: Nano-sensors bring unprecedented levels of detail to quality control, environmental monitoring and equipment maintenance. In industries such as pharmaceuticals and semiconductor production\u2014where microscopic precision is vital\u2014nano-sensors can detect and address defects in real time. This not only speeds up production but also ensures consistently high-quality outputs. Prioritize sustainability. Modern consumers and investors increasingly demand eco-friendly practices. Energy-efficient machinery and processes can lower costs and bolster brand reputation. The Challenge: U.S. manufacturing plants often rely on older machinery never designed to interface with AI tools or sensors. Upgrading can be expensive and time-consuming. U.S. manufacturing\u2019s decline has long been a sobering reality. Companies such as General Motors and Apple offshored significant parts of their production to countries like China, drawn by lower labor costs and relaxed regulations. This mass exodus of jobs devastated local economies, from the steel mills of Youngstown, Ohio, to the shipbuilding docks of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.", "https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20250312_08/": "He signed an executive order imposing 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 4. But one day before the levy was scheduled to come into force, he disclosed a one-month pause. Analysts are watching whether the tariff on the metals will add to uncertainty over the economic outlook. They are also monitoring how it will be seen by countries outside the US and by market players. The tariff took effect on March 4, but the Trump administration announced on the following day that automobiles would be excluded from the duty for a month. It granted the reprieve at the request of US carmakers. The Trump administration is imposing 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Wednesday. This comes despite exclusion requests from exporting countries, including Japan. The administration also decided on March 6 that items covered by a trade deal known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement would be removed from the tariff until April 2. Financial markets have been reeling from a series of shifts in tariff policies by US President Donald Trump. These and other changes to Trump's tariff policies fueled concerns about economic prospects, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 1,000 points for the five trading days of last week.

Tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump will have a devastating effect in the US economy, according to one of his biographers Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Kelly and Germania will be joined by a regular cast of commentators, political insiders, and former Trump staffers for a three times weekly run down on the world\u2019s biggest, most powerful soap opera. Search Welcome to MAGAland wherever you get your podcasts now. 'Donald believes that tariffs are paid by foreign countries, even though that's ridiculous,' the former New York Times reporter said on Monday, adding that it will be the American consumer who will pay for the tariffs. His commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has said one of Trump's goals with tariffs is to abolish the income tax and the IRS and have foreign countries pay for US services instead. President Trump has shocked economists as he continues to double down on tariffs on Canada and Mexico; on Tuesday he said he would\u00a0double the planned tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 percent for Canada, escalating the trade war as a response to the price increases Ontario put on electricity sold to the US. He then added, 'It takes a little time. It takes a little time.' 'Donald's tariff plan harkens back to the era in the United States in the late 18th and the 19th centuries when the government was very small and tariffs were a way to build up the economic muscle of domestic manufacturers,' Johnston said of Trump's economic policy. 'Donald is a con artist at heart. He's very good at it. He\u00a0has millions of people persuaded that his plan will make us rich. It's not possible for that to happen - the\u00a0actions he's taken cannot a lead to enormous wealth except for a relatively small number of people at the very top.' The biographer predicted that Trump's approval rating will suffer once the effects of tariffs start to bite. Welcome to MAGAland: The brand new politics podcast bringing you the latest news and gossip from Trump insiders. New episodes every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The economy has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism. And a widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the US economy may already be shrinking. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 890 points, or 2.1 percent, after paring an earlier loss of more than 1,100, while the Nasdaq composite skidded by 4percent. It was the worst day yet in a scary stretch where the S&P 500 has swung more than 1 percent, up or down, seven times in eight days because of Trump\u2019s on -and- off -again tariffs. The president has promised his economic plan will make America so rich 'you\u2019re not going to know where to spend all that money.' Welcome to MAGALand podcast: Pulitzer prize winner David Cay Johnston, a longtime Trump critic, says Americans could start feeling the effects of tariffs as soon as this summer Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group But on Monday the US\u00a0stock market had its worst day in three years as Wall Street questioned how much pain President Trump will let the economy endure through tariffs and other policies in order to get what he wants. Pulitzer prize winner David Cay Johnston, a longtime Trump critic who has written several books about him, spoke about Trump's 'disastrous' economic policy in the latest episode of DailyMail's new podcast, Welcome to Magaland. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7 percent to drag it close to 9 percent below its all-time high, which was set just last month. At one point, the S&P 500 was down 3.6 percent and on track for its worst day since 2022. That\u2019s when the highest inflation in generations was shredding budgets and raising worries about a possible recession that ultimately never came. 'Donald's ratings will continue to be good until people discover his economics are not good for them,' he said. I think it's going to be a while, but I won't be surprised if as early as summer we begin to see Americans souring and saying, \"wait a minute, what's going on here?\"' Trump has expressed admiration for the Gilded Age economy and president William McKinlye, who imposed heavy tariffs as the US economy was growing a century ago, before the US had an income tax. Asked over the weekend whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News: 'I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing.' 46 Published:  15:52 EDT, 11 March 2025   |  Updated:  16:35 EDT, 11 March 2025 By GERMANIA RODRIGUEZ POLEO, CHIEF U.S. REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM White House-insiders Kelly Laco and Germania Rodriguez bring you the latest from the heart of the Trump administration in the way that only dailymail.com can: the gossip; the scandals; the fashion; the family; the accusations; and \u2013 of course \u2013 the biggest political news stories of the day.

For example, economists at JPMorgan Chase\u00a0lowered their growth predictions and said there\u2019s a roughly 40% chance of recession in the second half of the year. Your session has expired, please login again. Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius cut his 2025 U.S. GDP growth forecast to 1.7%, pointing to the impact of tariffs on the economy and consumers. At the start of this year, he was predicting 2.4% growth. A day after Hatzius issued his research note, President Trump announced that an additional 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum will go into effect on Wednesday. The policy change likely will result in higher prices for U.S. manufacturers that rely on Canadian imports. Those tariffs join a burgeoning list of tariff increases that Trump has unveiled on roughly $1.4 trillion worth of goods coming from Canada, Mexico, and China. Those three countries are the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partners. The president has temporarily paused some of the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods until April. Oops! Looks like you have exceeded the limit to bookmark the image. Remove some to bookmark this image. You are just one step away from creating your watchlist! Hatzius notes that tariffs can dampen economic growth because they raise consumer prices and thereby cut real income. Tariffs also tend to tighten financial conditions, and trade policy uncertainty leads firms to delay investment, he writes. Hatzius estimates that tariffs will subtract 0.8 of a percentage point from GDP growth over the next year. Potential tax cuts and regulatory easing, which are seen as pro-growth, will only offset 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points of this drag, he says. Tariffs may also spur inflation. Hatzius anticipates that the core Personal Consumption Expenditure price index (core PCE) may reaccelerate to 3% later this year, up nearly half a percentage point from his prior forecast. \u201cIn theory, a tariff hike raises the price level permanently but only raises the inflation rate temporarily. In practice, this hinges on the assumption that inflation expectations remain well-anchored, which looks a bit more tenuous following the pickup in the UMich and Conference Board inflation expectations measures,\" he writes, referring to the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index, which shows sentiment souring. The outlook for the U.S. economy this year isn\u2019t so rosy anymore. Although Trump campaigned on implementing far-reaching tariffs, the president\u2019s policy announcements seem to have caught investors off guard and sent markets tumbling. So far this year, the S&P 500 is down 5.1%, and the Nasdaq has fallen 9.7%. The selloff wiped out gains stocks made after Election Day when investors focused on aspects of the president\u2019s agenda deemed more pro-growth, such as deregulation and tax cuts. Consumer discretionary and bank stocks, which are seen as economically sensitive, have been among the hardest hit. You are now subscribed to our newsletters.

NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The U.S. stock market fell further Tuesday following President Donald Trump\u2019s latest escalation in his trade war, briefly pulling Wall Street 10% below its record set last month. And like it\u2019s been for most of the past few weeks, the market\u2019s slide on Tuesday was erratic and dizzying. Helping to keep the market in check were several Big Tech stocks, which steadied a bit after getting walloped in recent months. Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla rose 3.8%, for example, after Trump said he would buy a Tesla in a show of support for \u201cElon\u2019s \u2018baby.\u2019\u201d Tuesday\u2019s swings followed more warning signals flashing about the economy as Trump\u2019s on -and- off -again rollout of tariffs creates confusion and pessimism for U.S. households and businesses.

Asked on Tuesday just how much pain Trump would be willing for the economy and stock market to take, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to give an exact answer. But she said earlier in the press briefing that \u201cthe president will look out for Wall Street and for Main Street.\u201d Other indexes likewise swung sharply through the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 478 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite ended up slipping 0.2%. In the bond market, Treasury yields clawed back some of their tumbles in recent months. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28% from 4.22% late Monday. In January, it was nearing 4.80%, before it began sinking on worries about the U.S. economy. Such head-spinning moves are becoming routine in what\u2019s been a scary ride for investors as Trump tries to remake the country and world through tariffs and other policies. Stocks have been heaving mostly lower on uncertainty about how much pain Trump is willing for the economy to endure in order to get what he wants. Its stock nevertheless rallied 8.3% after the airline said it would soon begin charging some passengers to check bags, among other announcements. Such tariffs can hurt the economy directly by raising prices for U.S. consumers and gumming up global trade. But even if they end up being milder than feared, all the whipsaw moves could create so much uncertainty that U.S. companies and consumers freeze, which would sap energy from the economy.

It\u2019s the latest signal that the U.S. job market remains relatively solid overall, for now at least, after the economy closed last year running at a healthy pace. In stock markets abroad, which have mostly been beating the United States so far this year, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Stocks began tumbling in the morning after Trump said he would double planned tariff increases on steel and aluminum coming from Canada.

Uncertainty surrounding US tariffs and potential retaliatory measures will continue to weigh on Asia's stock markets until more clarity emerges, analysts say.

SINGAPORE: Concerns over US tariffs have triggered volatility on Wall Street, but this does\u00a0not mean that Asia\u2019s stock markets will be in for a similarly rough ride, analysts said. \u201cThese will aid to counter a potential drop off in tariff-sensitive exports from the ongoing trade war,\u201d Mr Aw said. \u201cWhat started with a decline in expensive tech stocks \u2026 has given way to a broad-based equity sell-off as the looming threat of extended trade wars and softer economic data stoked fears of recession,\u201d said Mr Tim Murray, a capital markets specialist at T Rowe Price. As tariffs will inevitably be bad news for the region\u2019s export-oriented economies, analysts said cautious sentiment will likely persist in Asian markets until a clearer picture emerges of the extent and severity of tariffs \u2013 both by the US and other countries in retaliation \u2013 that will be implemented. Mr Zane Aw, research analyst at Phillip Securities Research, said the latest sell-off could potentially be the \u201cend of the bull run\u201d on Wall Street given factors such as expensive valuations and recent sluggish economic data.

(File photo: AP/Louise Delmotte) For Singapore, Mr Aw noted that opportunities lie in certain sectors that are \u201cbetter sheltered from a trade war\u201d, such as construction, utilities and telecommunications. But the trio of local banks - DBS, OCBC and UOB - which have been investors\u2019 favourites, may no longer be as attractive given the high valuations that may limit upside potential.

Excessive government spending was not only the cause of the rise in money supply growth and the burst of inflation but also led to an $8.47 trillion increase in debt and an unsustainable path to financial ruin if policies remained the same. According to the Congressional Budget Office, with no policy changes, the United States would have accumulated deficits of $12.6 trillion between 2025 and 2030. Net interest outlays were expected to grow from $881 billion in 2024 to $1.2 trillion by 2030, even assuming no recessions or unemployment increases. A research study from MIT Sloan published on July 17, 2024, by Mark Kritzman et al., titled \u201cThe Determinants of Inflation,\u201d concluded that federal spending was the overwhelming driver of the inflation spike in 2022, estimating it was two to three times more significant than any other factors. The United States will not enter a recession due to the change of administration, but because of the excess spending policies of the Biden years. Reducing federal spending, deficit, and debt accumulation is essential to recover the health of the economy. Private GDP should measure the economy, as government spending and debt do not drive productive growth. Stripping government spending can give us a more accurate picture of the reality of the productive sector in America. The latest Atlanta Fed estimates show a massive decline in net exports (-3.7 percent) due to a large increase in imports, a small decline in consumption of goods (-0.09 percent) but strong services (+0.62 percent) and rises in government expenditure (+0.34 percent) and a healthy increase in investment (+0.62 percent). Thus, the surprising factor is an abnormal slump in exports and a rise in imports that may be revised, because the trade deficit in December 2024 rose to a record $98.4 billion and GDP did not reflect such a massive slump in net exports. The concerning thing is that government spending continues to be excessive, and the United States is running an annualized $2.5 trillion deficit. Such an enormous decline is strange. How did we go from +2.3 percent to -1.5 percent in less than a month? That kind of collapse in an economy as large as the United States is exceedingly rare.

Tax ID# 52-1263436 In 2022, real GDP declined for two consecutive quarters under Biden\u2019s administration. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the first quarter saw a decrease of -1.6 percent in the annualized rate, followed by a 0.6 percent drop in the second quarter. Hundreds of analysts, commentators, and economists, along with the NBER, swiftly declared that this was not a recession. Thus, it is hilarious to read the hundreds of comments arguing that the Atlanta Fed NowCast means that the new administration\u2019s policies are causing a recession. The immediate reaction from the media is to call this the beginning of a \u201cTrump recession\u201d and blame it on President Trump\u2019s policies. Interestingly, on June 1, 2022, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow estimated the second quarter of 2022 growth at +1.3 percent. By July 1, 2022, it had dropped to -2.1 percent, a shift of 3.4 percentage points in 30 days. What did the media call it? \u201cGrowth scare\u201d. A similar thing happened in the third quarter of 2021. The estimate fell from 6.1 percent (July 30) to 2.3 percent (October 1), a 3.8-point drop over two months. The\u00a0Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow\u00a0model projection for real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025 (Q1 2025) is now showing a slump to -1.5 percent. This marks a significant downward revision from the previous estimate of 2.3 percent on February 19, 2025.

Government spending was out of control, leading money supply growth to soar, and the cumulative inflation suffered by Americans in the past four years is over 20.9 percent, with groceries and gas prices rising by more than 40 percent. Many analysts are warning that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts will cause a recession if government spending is aggressively reduced. However, cutting spending may \u201creduce\u201d GDP but does not harm productive economic growth; it will likely strengthen it.

Submitting articles to Mises Wire Please select all the ways you would like to hear from MisesInstitute: We must remember that US government spending financed by increasing federal debt accounted for about 22 percent to 25 percent of the total US GDP growth over 2021\u20132024. This extraordinary increase in government spending in the middle of a recovery led to record-high government debt and was the leading cause of money supply growth and, with it, the inflation burst that Americans are suffering today. The United States had a $7.59 trillion nominal GDP increase between 2021 and 2024 compared to a rise of $8.47 trillion in government debt. This marks the worst GDP growth adjusted for government debt accumulation since the 1930s.

Market consensus expects both core and headline inflation to ease slightly from previous readings. Live TV The warnings come as the S&P 500 extends its decline, falling to its lowest level since September, reflecting mounting investor concerns over economic uncertainty, trade tensions, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.6%, led by a sharp rebound in technology stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded slightly higher, adding 25 points. Nvidia jumped over 6%, while Meta Platforms and Tesla climbed 4% and 8%, respectively, as investors poured into beaten-down tech shares following the inflation report. The US Dollar Index (DXY) pulled back from session highs, while US stock futures edged higher, reflecting market optimism over potential rate cuts later this year. US inflation eased more than expected in February, with the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 2.8% year-on-year, below the estimated 2.9%, according to fresh data released on Wednesday. On a month-on-month basis, inflation rose 0.2%, also softer than the expected 0.3%. \u201cInstead, the reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse, and the administration is managing expectations towards tariff-induced near-term economic weakness,\u201d Hatzius said in a note to clients on Tuesday, as reported by Fortune. Read more here \u201cWhat Trump has been doing has not been helpful for US equity markets,\u201d said Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro Research. He added that while he doesn\u2019t see a recession yet, policy uncertainty alone has never been the sole trigger for an economic downturn.

The S&P 500 briefly entered correction territory on Tuesday, falling 10% from its February peak, and has lost nearly 8% over the past month, with the Dow and Nasdaq shedding 6.6% and 11.3%, respectively. Trending Now However, analysts and economists have warned that US President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could fuel inflation, adding uncertainty to the outlook. The CPI data will be a key test for these forecasts, shaping expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s next policy move. Bitcoin traded near $82,700 on Wednesday, stabilising after recent losses as investors braced for potential volatility ahead of the US inflation report. The cryptocurrency had earlier dropped 9.14% in a single day, breaking below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $85,664 on Sunday, before finding support at $78,258 and rebounding 5.52% on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap data. The US economy is projected to slow further, with S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasting GDP growth to decline from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.9% in both 2025 and 2026, before easing to 1.6% in 2027, according to a report cited by ANI. Calculators Network 18 Group : The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.8% year-on-year in February, down from 3% in January and below the forecasted 2.9%, bringing inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The data fueled optimism that monetary policy easing could come sooner than anticipated, triggering an immediate jump in Bitcoin\u2019s price, extending its recovery from last week\u2019s downturn.

Full article here News India\u2019s retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), cooled to 3.61% in February, down from 5.09% in the same period last year, according to data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on March 12. The figure also came in lower than the 3.85% estimate from a CNBC-TV18 poll of economists. This latest market slump marks one of the biggest selloffs in months, as investors remain jittery over the potential economic fallout of Trump\u2019s proposed trade policies. \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting on some kind of policy response, either from the Fed or the administration,\u201d Warren Pies, co-founder of 3Fourteen Research, told CNBC, adding that while the market may be stabilizing, \u201cit\u2019s not time to buy the dip just yet.\u201d Popular Categories Spot gold dipped 0.2% to $2,908.93 an ounce at 0720 GMT, while US gold futures fell by the same margin. \u201cGold is operating in \u2018consolidation mode\u2019 ahead of the next batch of US inflation data,\u201d said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade, as reported by Reuters. Gold prices edged lower on Wednesday, pressured by a stronger dollar as investors awaited US inflation data for clarity on the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-cut trajectory. Lingering concerns over trade tensions, economic slowdown fears, and reports of a potential Ukraine-Russia ceasefire also influenced sentiment. Investor anxiety is rising on Wall Street, with markets grappling with uncertain tariff policies, persistent inflation, and an unclear Fed rate-cut timeline. Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and RBC Capital Markets, have begun tempering their bullish outlooks for 2025, as Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats fuel fears of slowing economic growth. The latest reading marks a significant decline from January\u2019s 4.26% and remains below the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) target range, providing room for policymakers to maintain an accommodative stance. The year-on-year inflation rate for February 2025 was recorded at 3.75%, reinforcing signs of easing price pressures ahead of the much-awaited US CPI release later today. The latest US inflation data helped ease fears of stagflation, which had been fueled by concerns over President Donald Trump\u2019s volatile trade policies. The cooler-than-expected CPI report has also left room for the Federal Reserve to cut rates. The S&P 500 snapped a three-week losing streak on Wednesday, rallying 0.8% after softer-than-expected US inflation data eased concerns about the economy and reinforced expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. A growing number of economists are warning of a rising risk of recession in the US, with JP Morgan increasing its estimate to 40% from 30%, citing policy shifts that are \u201ctilting away from growth\u201d. Similarly, Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi raised his recession forecast from 15% to 35%, pointing to the impact of tariffs and trade disruptions. Let's Connect with CNBCTV 18 Stephen Juneau, US economist at Bank of America Securities, cautioned that persistent inflation could complicate the Fed\u2019s task. \u201cThe longer that inflation runs above the Fed\u2019s target, even if it is due to temporary forces like tariffs, the greater the chance that expectations de-anchor to the upside,\u201d he told Reuters. However, economists remain divided on the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy path. Goldman Sachs now forecasts core PCE inflation\u2014a key Fed gauge\u2014rising to 3% by December, up from 2.65% in January, citing inflationary pressures from Trump\u2019s recent tariff hikes. The US equity market downturn extended into Tuesday, following Monday\u2019s sharp selloff, which was triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats to Canada. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.14% to close at 41,433.48, while the Nasdaq, which plunged 4% in the previous session, edged down 0.18%. Market Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, climbed 3.1% YoY, in line with estimates, while the MoM increase was 0.2%, slightly below the 0.3% forecast. The cooler-than-expected inflation figures could reinforce expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 US GDP growth forecast to 1.7% from 2.4%, citing worsening trade policy expectations. Chief economist Jan Hatzius noted that the bank now expects the average US tariff rate to rise by 10 basis points this year, double its previous estimate. Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $84,000 on Wednesday after US inflation data came in softer than expected, strengthening market expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. India\u2019s industrial production rose 5% in January, exceeding market expectations of 3.4% and improving from December\u2019s 3.5%, according to official data released Tuesday. The growth was driven by strong manufacturing and mining activity, despite ongoing global economic uncertainties. \u201cS&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts 1.9% US GDP growth in 2025 followed by 1.9% growth in 2026,\u201d the report stated, attributing the weaker outlook to a slowdown in the first half of 2025.

The budget presentations during this period have consistently emphasised the critical role of the energy sector in generating foreign exchange (forex) earnings. In addition to this, the government also launched an auction for deepwater oil and gas exploration to ensure sustained energy output. Projects like Shell\u2019s Manatee and BP\u2019s Cypre are anticipated to enhance gas supply by 2028, further strengthening forex earnings. Between 2015 and 2017, the global decline in oil prices led to reduced revenues from the energy sector. The government acknowledged the need for diversification to mitigate dependency on energy exports. This prompted initiatives to encourage investment in non-energy sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, aiming to create a more resilient economy and reduce vulnerability to fluctuating energy prices. Good morning, I\u2019m so thankful that we got so many of you to join us this morning for yet another milestone in CLICO Credit Union\u2019s almost 80-year journey of service, growth, and unwavering commitment to our members and the communities we serve. These efforts aimed to bolster the country\u2019s energy production while ensuring that Trinidad and Tobago remained competitive in the global market. However, two years later, oil and gas prices stabilised, resulting in a moderate recovery of forex earnings. Initiatives were also introduced to enhance production efficiency and attract foreign investment in the energy sector. AN unused piece of equipment intended for NiQuan Energy Trinidad Ltd\u2019s operations is among several assets now up for sale by the receiver, just after the seventh anniversary of the gas-to-liquid plant\u2019s grand opening. \u201cMidstream and downstream companies currently do not remit their taxes in USD. In the budget, the Minister of Finance signalled an intent to amend existing legislation to mandate these companies to pay their tax obligations in US dollars. Based on data from the Gas Master Plan, between 2009-2014, these midstream and downstream companies contributed US$31.2 billion in corporation taxes. By ensuring these companies pay in US dollars, the government will be adding to the forex pool,\u201d the TTEITI stated. The unused FT Max Catalyst-T 2811, weighing 231,000 pounds and used in gas-to-liquids (GTL) processes, is being sold by receiver manager Varune Mungal. The energy sector, which includes oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals, has historically accounted for about 80% of Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s export revenues. While these payments significantly contribute to government revenue, a portion is paid in foreign currency. In late 2023, T&T renegotiated contracts related to its flagship project, Atlantic LNG, leading to increased government revenue from liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The new terms allowed LNG cargoes to be sold at 15% to 55% above the Henry Hub benchmark, ensuring greater returns compared to previous agreements. This revamp allowed T&T to maximise returns from its natural gas resources at a time when global LNG demand remains strong. \u201cOver the eight-year period reviewed, 2022 and in some cases 2015, coincided with the highest USD payments received for the companies. This is attributed to higher commodity prices in 2022 despite lower production levels, compared to 2015, which saw increased production but lower prices,\u201d it highlighted. The pandemic led to global shutdowns, forcing businesses, schools, and public services to close. Many employees transitioned to remote work, while others faced job losses as companies struggled to stay afloat. The economic downturn resulted in widespread closures, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being particularly vulnerable. It really is with great excitement and pride that I have the honour of welcoming you to the official launch of CLICO Credit Union\u2019s Business Hub. Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device. \u201cThe Atlantic Train 1 plant has not been operational since 2020. The Atlantic shareholders, bp, Shell and the National Gas Company of Trinidad & Tobago (NGC), agreed to decouple the Train from the rest of the Atlantic facility with a view to decommissioning it. The Train has been made safe and decoupling and decommissioning work scopes are being planned,\u201d bp stated. The government launched Vision 2030 in 2016 as part of its long-term plan to transition towards a more diversified economy. It emphasised the development of sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, and information technology to reduce dependence on oil and gas revenues. The vision aimed to create sustainable economic growth, generate new employment opportunities, and improve the country\u2019s overall economic resilience in the face of global energy market fluctuations. Between 2021 and 2022, as the world recovered from Covid-19-related delays, global energy demand surged, bolstering T&T\u2019s forex reserves. The TTEITI stated that the total payments trend highlights a fluctuating pattern driven by significant surges in specific years, heavily influenced by BP and Shell\u2019s contributions. Instagram Five years after the Covid-19 outbreak, businesses in Trinidad and Tobago are still grappling with its lasting effects. We have partnered with so many of you over the last two years, emphasizing the importance of mutually beneficial strategic partnerships and collaboration. On September 27 last year, just days before the restructuring of Atlantic LNG took effect on October 1, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley delivered the feature address at the Point Fortin Administration Building to commemorate Atlantic LNG\u2019s 25th anniversary and the commencement of the restructured agreement. \u201cShell displays sharp increases in 2019 and 2022, significantly impacting the total for that year, which again exceeds US$1.5 billion. Other companies, such as EOG Resources and the National Gas Company (NGC), made relatively consistent but smaller contributions, totalling US$1.3 billion and US$1.5 billion, respectively. BHP/Woodside\u2019s payments range from US$4.2 million to US$154 million over the period,\u201d the report stated.

A recession would hurt Long Islanders across the income spectrum and affect businesses big and small. \u201cEconomics is not an exact science so there\u2019s not one exact definition,\u201d said Mariano Torras, an economics professor at Adelphi University and chair of its Finance and Economics Department. Still, other analysts said the chances of a recession are small this year and that the economy remains relatively stable. The president\u2019s recent remarks might have deepened these concerns. Torras said that \u201chistorically, a traditional definition has been two quarters in a row of negative GDP growth.\u201d Some local economists interviewed by Newsday said the economy is relatively stable despite the uncertainty. But they attribute the current economic unease to plummeting consumer confidence, recent stock market declines and an ongoing trade war\u00a0stemming\u00a0from President Donald Trump imposing\u00a0tariffs \u2014 and tariff\u00a0threats \u2014 against the nation\u2019s largest trading partners, which include not only adversaries such as China but also key allies such as Mexico and Canada. But, he added, \"It\u2019s more like a rule of thumb.\u201d Here are four key insights from Long Island economists that might help answer some of the questions on peoples' minds. \u201cThe answer to that question would depend on the particular individual,\u201d Torras said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with our tastes, our expectations, and what we can do without.\" \u201cWhen you see investment plans halted, you need to start worrying,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all worrying now.\u201d Following his comments, online search engines saw a surge in queries such as \u201cis a recession coming in 2025,\u201d \u201chow to prepare for a recession\u201d and \u201cwhat is a recession.\u201d Get more on these and other NewsdayTV stories In an interview with Fox News Channel over the weekend, when asked if he anticipated a recession this year, he stated, \u201cThere is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d But recessions are hard to project, and there is no immediate way to know if one is happening, economists said. \u201cTypically, the consumer, in the face of uncertainty, is going to cut back on discretionary purchases, is going to travel less, and pull back spending on more big-ticket items,\" Patel said. \u201cThe people who are impacted the hardest, quite simply are those who have the least means,\u201d Torras said. \u201cSomeone who has a few businesses, maybe they have to tighten their belt, lay off a few employees and watch their spending, but they are not affected in the same way.\u201d Stay in the know on jobs, retail and all things business across Long Island.

Some economists and policymakers might disagree about the exact definition of a recession, but the most widely respected take on the matter comes from the National Bureau of Economic Research, an American private nonprofit research organization that proposes start and end dates for U.S. recessions.\u00a0According to the group, a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy that lasts more than a few months, typically measured by indicators such as real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales. When a recession has begun it is largely \"determined after the fact,\" said Shital Patel, labor market analyst with the state labor department's Hicksville office. \u201cYou generally only know after its begun because the GDP figures are lagging indicators,\" said John A. Rizzo, an economist and professor at Stony Brook University. The last major recession to hit the country, commonly known as the Great Recession, peaked in 2008 and officially ended in 2009, though the recovery would last several more years. The financial collapse was largely driven by the bursting of the housing bubble, risky subprime mortgage lending\u00a0and the subsequent credit crunch that sent shockwaves through the global financial system, as employers hemorrhaged jobs and many people lost their homes in the foreclosure crisis. He added, \u201cIt takes a little time. It takes a little time.\u201d As Torras said, there's a lot of variability in how people might respond. But there are some common-sense conventions. Conesa said affluent people might see their investments lose value, but they have the means to cushion these changes.\" Some people across Long Island and throughout the nation are grappling with concerns over the U.S. economy, with many worried about a potential recession this year. Several local economists said there are multiple indicators used to determine if a recession might be coming, including increased unemployment rates, a declining stock market, abrupt drops in investment from businesses and declines in consumer spending, especially\u00a0consumers postponing big-ticket purchases on items such as\u00a0cars and pricy home appliances. But while consumers\u00a0may see higher prices at grocery stores or struggle more with other issues of affordability, these economic challenges alone are not sufficient to be considered a recession. However, she said, those very actions also contribute to a recession as reduced consumer spending leads to declines in business revenue, which can result in job layoffs.

The increasing need for effective, inference-oriented chips is transforming the AI semiconductor industry. Although Nvidia's wide-ranging strategy remains in the lead, niche-focused start-ups and Big Tech companies are pursuing niche opportunities aggressively. Vipul Ved Prakash, CEO of Together AI, spoke to the increasing significance of inference. \"I think doing inference at scale is going to be the largest workload on the internet at some point,\" he stated. Inference tasks, which require greater memory for processing longer and more complex queries, have also opened the market to alternatives beyond Nvidia\u2019s general-purpose GPUs. Feldman noted that Cerebras\u2019 chips, used by French AI start-up Mistral, have demonstrated significant performance improvements. Inference, whereby AI models respond to user requests, is turning into a key requirement in AI computing. The trend is unlocking the door for Nvidia's competitors, such as start-ups Cerebras and Groq, and technology giants Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta, to disrupt Nvidia's dominance. \u201cWe are producing answers for Le Chat in sometimes a second while [OpenAI\u2019s] o1 would have taken 40,\u201d Feldman said.

Nvidia\u2019s response and market outlook With AI applications growing and becoming more diversified, industry observers expect a multi-player, complex battle for inference computing dominance. \"The level of inference compute required is already 100x higher than it was when large language models began,\" Huang said. \"And that's just the beginning.\" More than 75% of future computing and power demand in US data centres will be inference-driven, say Morgan Stanley analysts. Capital spending on inference in \"frontier AI\" is expected to grow from $122.6 billion in 2025 to $208.2 billion in 2026, says Barclays. DeepSeek's R1 and v3 models have hastened the move to inference with increased efficiency and reduced costs. Such advancements set off a stock market buzz earlier this year, indicating the rapid pace at which the industry is changing. But Prakash of Together AI\u2014whose firm has Nvidia as an investor\u2014added that flexibility is a major strength in a rapidly changing field. \"The one benefit of general-purpose computing is that while the model architectures are shifting, you just have more flexibility,\" he said. Even with the competition, Nvidia insists that its chips are still strong for training and inference. CEO Jensen Huang pointed out that Nvidia's new Blackwell chips were created for better inference performance.

Since then, his back-and-forth on tariffs for Canada and Mexico roiled the stock market, with the S&P 500 recording its worst week since last September. Stock losses continued Monday and Tuesday after Trump's comments. More tariffs are being implemented against steel and aluminum products on Wednesday, and Trump's pledging to move forward with \"reciprocal\" tariffs starting on April 2. The White House on Tuesday also declined to rule out a recession, as officials sought to cast the market turmoil as a \"snapshot of a moment in time\" before Trump's policies bear their intended impact. \"Starting on Day 1, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,\" he said at a rally in Montana, where he told supporters: \"This election is about saving our economy.\" He was pressed on his hesitation to strike down the possibility later Sunday as he spoke with reporters on Air Force One. Trump started to change his tune not long after his victory, however, saying in an interview with Time magazine, published in December, that bringing down food costs will be \"very hard.\" During his first major speech to Congress and the nation since his inauguration, Trump last week defended his imposition of steep levies on key U.S. trading partners like Canada, China and Mexico. A week later, he made a show of displaying cartons of eggs, bacon, milk and other grocery products outside his New Jersey golf course as he railed against the Biden administration's policies. During an interview on Fox News \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Trump was asked if he is expecting a recession this year after the Atlanta Federal Reserve projected negative GDP growth for the first quarter of 2025. \"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There will be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much,\" he said. \"Ill tell you what, of course you hesitate. Who knows? All I know is this: Were going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and were going to become so rich, youre not going to know where to spend all that money,\" he said. \"Im telling you, you just watch.  Were going to have jobs. Were going to have open factories. Its going to be great.\" \"I hate to predict things like that,\" Trump responded. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\" \"When I win, I will immediately bring prices down,\" Trump said at the time. \"We are in a period of economic transition,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters when asked directly if she could reassure Americans there wouldn't be a downturn. Leavitt blamed the Biden administration for what she said was an \"economic disaster\" left to Trump -- despite Biden overseeing a soft economic landing -- and pointed to other indicators she said were positive signs for Americans, including a boost in manufacturing jobs last month and reports of companies looking to expand operations in America. \"The American people, CEOs, and people on Wall Street and on Main Street should bet on this president,\" Leavitt told reporters. \"He is a dealmaker. He is a businessman and he's doing what's right for our country.\" Then-candidate Donald Trump, at a campaign rally last August as the 2024 race for the White House was heating up, made a promise to voters to quickly bring economic relief if elected.", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-tariffs-spark-trade-34844502": "Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister of Australia, said the tariffs went \"against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship\". Australia will not level tit-for-tat duties, but said those imposed on his country were \"a form of economic self-harm, and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation\". Alasdair McDiarmid, the Assistant General Secretary for steelworker's union Community, said the tariffs will prove \"hugely damaging\" and threaten jobs, adding it would also blow back on the US. He said: \"These US tariffs on UK steel exports are hugely damaging and they threaten jobs. For the US it\u2019s also self-defeating, as the UK is a leading supplier of specialist steel products required by their defence and aerospace sectors.\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters this morning the bloc was hoping to \"explore better solutions with the US\" after ordering $28 billion (\u00a321.6 billion) tariffs on US goods from next month. She said: \"We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geoeconomic and political uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with such tariffs.\" \"But they have an advantage: they seem to help Trump find his senses, as evidence by the flurry of announcements and cancellation of tariffs.\" Those nations stand to lose the most financially, especially Mexico, for which steel exports to the US are worth the most - around $4.3 billion (\u00a33.3 billion). Other nations, namely the EU, while exporting less, have decried Mr Trump's move as damaging for global trade and international relations. The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on US industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to 25 percent. The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the US tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. The latest round of tariffs - which were imposed the night before the global steel tariffs activated - were ordered on steel and aluminium, with an additional 25 percent added to the existing 25 percent rate, bringing it to 50 percent. The move was a reaction to previously Trump-supporting Ontario governor Doug Ford's move to respond to Mr Trump with a 25 percent tariff on electricity from his state. Donald Trump's trade war came to Europe this morning as the deal-seeking US President activated his 25 percent steel and aluminium tariffs - further destabilising the global economy. He added the overarching trade wars would have a \"bad\" impact, saying price increases across the supply chain would mean \"we will all suffer\". The EU vowed today to respond with a series of its own measures this morning, as has Canada, while the UK is so far taking the tariff impact on its chin. The Government has been urged to act as the tariffs hit British steel, but an expert has warned that doing so could doubly harm the economy when it is already in a fragile state. Many countries hit by the tariffs have resolved to respond with rounds of their own against the US, and representatives for Brit workers have advised the UK government to do the same. Mr McDiarmid recommended the UK should respond with appropriate \"defence measures\", including \"at the very least\", matching the tariffs. He said: \"The UK\u2019s response must include delivering a robust Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the strongest possible trade defence measures to shield our sector from diverted imports. At a minimum we must at least match any measures taken by the EU. Get email updates with the day's biggest stories He said: \"Manufacturing today is based on deeply interconnected supply chains. This means that any tariff on material such as steel or aluminium makes production more expensive for everyone. For instance, if a US car manufacturer needs to pay 25 percent more to buy steel, this will reflect immediately on the price of cars.\" The EU duties aim for pressure points in the US while minimizing additional damage to Europe. The tariffs - taxes on imports - primarily target Republican-held states, hitting soybeans in House speaker Mike Johnson's Louisiana, but also beef and poultry in Kansas and Nebraska. Produce in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia is also on the list. Steel exports make up a much larger proportion of Ukraine's economy, making up 14.6 percent of exports and 5.7 percent of the country's total GDP. In 2023, figures showed that steel made up 57.9 percent of the country's exports to the US, suggesting it will suffer from Trump's latest orders. He said: \"While the EU and Canada seem to go for the 'retaliation' approach, adding their own counter measures to the US import taxes (tariffs), the UK may choose to try to weather the storm. Retaliation hurts your economy again: your exporters struggle due to US import taxes, and your own consumers and producers struggle due to domestic import taxes. Canadian leaders have repeatedly against tariffs coming from the US, any of which would prove nationally devastating thanks to the country's massive economic stakes. The US is Canada's largest trading partner, with the World Integrated Trade Solution estimating a huge 76.8 per cent share of its international exports going south of the border in 2022. Canada has emerged as one of Mr Trump's chief targets during his latest terms, with the US President seemingly keen to have the nation become the \"treasured\" 51st state. He has independently levelled and rescinded tariffs on his country's vital trade partner neighbour, from which it imports the most steel. Dr Foucart said the affected nations would likely take a specific message from the experience and ensure global production is not too dependant on a single financial partner. He said: \"The main message every country will take home from this is that our production cannot be too dependent from inputs from a single partner. While the costs are mounting for the country in the middle of a fight for its life, Dr Foucart said the most significant impact would be the ongoing western trade war. He said: \"I would say the main impact is that trade wars between Western partners (the EU, Canada, the US) play in the hands of Russia, by making us all poorer and less united. And perhaps less focused on our joint support for Ukraine.\" Dr Renaud Foucart, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Lancaster, told the Mirror UK manufacturing - which represents nearly 20 percent of the UK's GDP - would become more expensive. The Ukrainian Steel Association warned in February, weeks before the tariffs came into effect, that import duties could cost the war-weary industry about 2.4billion hryvnias (\u00a342.7million) in revenue and the government 1billion hryvnias (\u00a317.7million) in taxes per year. In 2013, the UK produced 5.6million tonnes of steel, a tiny 0.3 percent of the global total. While the proportion of trade is low, the industry is spread across around 1,100 UK businesses, which support 40,000 jobs. These are expected to be directly threatened by the tariffs. Mr Trump's tariffs have been strapped to all US imports, meaning British steel hasn't been spared from the order despite the seemingly positive relationship shared by the President and PM Keir Starmer. The UK steel industry is a relatively small proportion of the country's GDP, contributing around \u00a32billion to the UK economy in 2020 and representing around 0.1 percent of total economic output. The sizeable new tariffs, seen as a bid to by the Commander-in-Chief to reorder trade in his favour, are the latest in a series of border-hopping punitive financial measures designed by Trump to redress so-called \"bad deals\". He believes the US is ultimately losing out on the world's stage, and is now aiming to renegotiate and renege - but has come under fire from allies he has targeted. \"This is what Europe is trying to do by \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China. And China by trying to reduce its dependency on exporting to the US. This implies we do not always choose the cheaper product but also think in terms of economic autonomy. Higher prices for everyone, but higher resilience also.\" The US imports more steel from Canada than any other country, according to the US Department of Commerce, having received six million tonnes from its immediate neighbour in 2024. Brazil and Mexico, the other US neighbour, come in second and third on the tariff table, exporting 4.1 and 3.2 milion tonnes to the country respectively. \"We\u2019re incredibly disappointed that the US has decided to take this course of action and we will continue to work with steel companies and the UK Government to deliver the best possible outcome for our members and our industry.\" But Dr Foucart warned that retaliatory measures may doubly hurt the economy, hitting both exporters and consumers. EU members Germany, Ireland and Italy, all of which have a trade surplus with the US, are anticipating the most significant impact from the tariffs. In 2023, Germany's surplus was worth \u20ac57 billion (\u00a347.9 billion), with Ireland's worth \u20ac50 billion (\u00a342.1 billion) and Italy's \u20ac41 billion (\u00a334.5 billion).", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-11/stocks-swoon-on-tariff-escalation": "To continue, please click the box below to let us know you're not a robot.

Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago. That means consumers and businesses will continue to face higher borrowing costs for longer, while still grappling with elevated price hikes, economists say. Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said. Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week. Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago.

To prevent any escalation of trade tensions and safeguard exporters\u2019 interests, India is reportedly reassessing its tariff structure, particularly in high-sensitivity sectors such as automobiles, textiles, leather, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and agriculture. The second round of trade talks is expected to be crucial in shaping the contours of the India-US BTA and may serve as a stepping stone toward a broader Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in the future. India\u2019s proactive stance comes amid increased global scrutiny on trade imbalances. In a recent address, former US President Donald Trump criticized India\u2019s high import tariffs, calling them \u201cvery unfair,\u201d and threatened the implementation of reciprocal tariffs on countries imposing levies on American goods, effective April 2, 2025. Despite these tensions, both sides have continued to emphasize their commitment to strengthening commercial ties.

While the memo heightens pressure on countries like India to reduce trade imbalances, it has not yet translated into direct tariffs. India\u2019s response so far has been to intensify diplomatic and trade consultations rather than engage in retaliatory measures, underscoring its interest in preserving the positive momentum in bilateral trade. In a written statement to the lower house of Parliament on March 11, 2025, Minister of State (MoS) for Commerce and Industry, Jitin Prasada, confirmed that both nations are working toward a comprehensive multi-sector trade agreement. The proposed pact seeks to enhance market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration. These efforts come amid ongoing concerns regarding potential US reciprocal tariffs on Indian exports and aim to reinforce economic cooperation between the two countries. Trade between the two countries has seen a steady rise in recent years. In 2023, India-US bilateral trade reached US$190.08 billion, comprising US$123.89 billion in goods trade and US$66.19 billion in services trade. India exported goods worth US$83.77 billion to the US, while imports stood at US$40.12 billion, giving India a trade surplus of US$43.65 billion\u2014a key point of contention in US trade discussions.

The following sectors are under active consideration for potential tariff concessions: India\u2019s ongoing efforts to refine its tariff cut offers represent not just a tactical response to US concerns, but also a strategic opportunity to integrate more deeply into global supply chains and attract greater foreign investment. With both nations committed to enhancing trade, the success of these negotiations could define the next phase of India-US economic cooperation, paving the way for a stronger, more resilient bilateral partnership in the years ahead. India has begun formulating the Terms of Reference for a proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US, with the goal of finalizing the initial phase of negotiations by fall 2025. The ToR will outline the objectives, negotiation framework, and scope of the agreement between the two countries. While India is keen on advancing trade relations with the US, it remains cautious about overexposing sensitive sectors to foreign competition. The government\u2019s evolving approach appears to be one of calibrated liberalization, wherein tariff reductions are matched with domestic industry safeguards and export incentives. Media reports indicate that the central government is consulting key industry stakeholders this week to evaluate the scope of tariff concessions that could be extended to the US under a multi-sector BTA. These discussions are aimed at crafting a revised, mutually beneficial tariff offer ahead of the second round of formal negotiations. Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, concluded a visit to the US on March 7, 2025, followed by internal consultations with Indian exporters and trade associations. As per reports, Goyal is likely to visit the US again with revised tariff order later in March 2025. As India and the US strengthen their economic partnership, the Indian government is actively preparing revised tariff reduction proposals for the upcoming round of bilateral trade negotiations. Media reports indicate that India has initiated work on the Terms of Reference (ToR) for a proposed Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), with the aim of concluding the initial phase of discussions by fall 2025. However, Prasad has clarified to the Parliament that no reciprocal tariffs have yet been imposed by the US. He reaffirmed that India is committed to constructive engagement with the US to enhance market access and reduce trade barriers. Subscribe now to receive our weekly India Edition newsletter.

The Amendment expanded the bank syndicate to include members from the Farm Credit System and increased the amount of revolving credit facility commitments by $25.0 million.

Tariffs will make our country rich,\" Trump responded. \u201cYou want to see a market crash? If we lost this election, I think the market would go down the tubes.\u201d In response to a question about whether his tariffs caused the turmoil in the markets, Trump said: \u201cBiden gave us a horrible economy. He gave us horrible inflation. And I think the market was going to go very, very bad. If anything, I have a lot of very smart people, friends of mine, and great businessmen. They're not investing because of what I've done.\u201d On whether he thinks there will be a recession: \u201cI don't see it at all. I think this country's going to boom. But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way. The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing, but the results are going to be 20 times greater. Remember, Trump is always right.\u201d April 25, 2024, on his way into court for his criminal trial in New York Jan. 7, 2025, during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago \u201cWe are a nation whose stock market's continued success is contingent on MAGA winning the next election.\u201d \u201cThe stock market is, in a sense, crashing. The numbers are very bad. This is Bidenomics. It\u2019s catching up with him. It\u2019s lucky that it\u2019s catching up before he leaves office as opposed to after he leaves office.\u201d Feb. 21, 2025, speaking to the nation's governors at the White House \u201cDow Jones UP 742 based on the fact that the Market expects a TRUMP WIN in November!

BIDEN IS SOUND ASLEEP. ALL CAUSED BY INEPT U.S. LEADERSHIP!\u201d After a week of wild swings on Wall Street over uncertainty about his tariffs, Trump was asked whether he was expecting a recession in 2025. He said: \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d He added, \u201cIt takes a little time. It takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us.\" Trump started praising Bessent and said: \u201cYou know what his theory is? The stock market is the only sign of life, and it\u2019s only going up because everyone thinks Trump is going to win the election. And others, too. Others, too. I\u2019m seeing it a lot.

Organizations must navigate complex compliance standards spanning multiple jurisdictions while addressing copyright protection for AI-generated code. Industry standards organizations have developed frameworks extending beyond technical specifications to incorporate ethical considerations, aligning with UNESCO's emphasis on preventing bias in AI systems. These guidelines ensure transparent and accountable operations without compromising innovation. \u2022 Customer Service: Modern contact centers use AI for speech recognition, sentiment analysis and natural language processing, enabling faster, more personalized support. Telecommunications providers demonstrate the practical value of this coordinated approach through daily operations: The December 2024 launch of advanced multi-agent capabilities inside AWS introduces an architecture where specialized AI agents operate within defined domains under central coordination. This system balances complex problem-solving with operational efficiency through intelligent task routing and real-time monitoring, processing thousands of decisions per second while maintaining service quality. ByAndres Zunino Network security can particularly benefit from coordinated multi-agent systems. They analyze vast amounts of data to detect threats early and respond before disruptions occur. Automated response mechanisms further reduce security incidents and improve recovery times. As these systems continuously learn from past events, they strengthen overall network resilience. Andres Zunino, cofounder of ZirconTech. An AWS partner, his company delivers traditional web and blockchain solutions. The implementation framework operates across three integrated tiers. At its foundation, core agents manage essential functions like signal processing and bandwidth allocation, processing millions of operations to maintain network stability. Domain specialists handle specific operational areas, while coordination agents ensure system-wide optimization. This architecture supports both granular control and broad oversight, with each tier operating under specific performance metrics and quality controls. \u2022 Traffic Management: Systems adjust in real time to changing network conditions, ensuring smooth performance. The telecommunications industry's extensive experience managing complex networks positions it ideally to pioneer these advanced systems. Decades of expertise in critical infrastructure enable providers to establish implementation benchmarks that influence other sectors. This leadership extends beyond technical deployment to include developing governance frameworks that balance innovation with reliability. Regular system audits, comprehensive monitoring protocols and clear accountability measures provide the foundation for sustainable growth. API standardization amplifies these capabilities by creating unified interfaces across carriers. This advancement enables seamless integration of multi-agent systems across previously isolated networks, allowing developers to build applications that span multiple providers. The resulting framework maintains individual carrier control while fostering innovation and consistent service delivery across diverse environments. These innovations can lead to faster response times, quicker issue resolution and more reliable service overall. Regulatory compliance and risk management are also streamlined. Multi-agent AI adjusts operations to comply with different regulations, maintaining detailed audit trails of automated decisions. This ensures quick regulatory responses while keeping policies consistent across networks. By automating compliance, telecom providers can improve governance without sacrificing efficiency. \u2022 Network Maintenance: AI predicts and prevents technical issues before they cause service disruptions. Tech industry visionaries foresee a fundamental shift in network intelligence. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella envisions humans collaborating with AI agent swarms, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang projects a trillion-dollar market emerging from this technology. Their predictions signal more than a market opportunity; they represent a reimagining of how telecommunications networks operate and serve users. , Forbes Councils Member. To mitigate biases in AI models, providers should leverage their existing data science teams, while critical functions should remain under human oversight using current staff. Additionally, ongoing training programs should keep teams informed on AI ethics. By adopting these practices, providers can deploy AI systems that are both innovative and responsible\u2014enhancing network performance while preserving customer trust. This approach ensures that multi-agent AI systems remain cutting-edge yet reliable, reinforcing stakeholder confidence. In the years ahead, networks won't just connect us; they'll intelligently enhance how we communicate and work. The integration of multi-agent systems brings critical security and governance considerations to telecommunications networks. As these systems access sensitive data and critical infrastructure, providers must implement comprehensive security frameworks that protect against emerging threats while preserving the benefits of automation. Security experts advocate for layered defenses combining traditional network security with AI-specific safeguards, particularly crucial when multiple agents exchange confidential information across network segments. Infrastructure management through multi-agent systems demonstrates similar advances in protection and efficiency. Predictive maintenance systems monitor performance across multiple regions, identifying potential failures before they affect service. This capability, combined with automated resource allocation, reduces downtime and optimizes costs. As AI systems learn and adapt, maintenance strategies evolve to meet changing demands. Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? Maintaining this balance requires telecommunications providers to integrate privacy by design, ensuring secure data handling within existing safeguards. They must also enhance transparency by documenting AI decisions in a way that aligns with current governance structures. I believe multi-agent systems will fundamentally reshape telecommunications networks, fulfilling the vision outlined by industry leaders. These technologies enable providers to deliver increasingly sophisticated services while maintaining essential security and reliability. As the industry navigates this transition, success depends on maintaining the delicate balance between technological advancement and responsible deployment.", "https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-and-nasdaq-on-course-for-higher-open-as-cpi-inflation-data-looms/card/tariff-worries-take-center-stage-again-as-u-s-stocks-wipe-out-most-post-cpi-gains-RfdBnPMf4GbyH0tP6XLr": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker"}, "summary_completions": [[{"article_number": "ARTICLE 30", "article_url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14487361/trump-biographer-explosive-predicition-economy-tariff-chaos.html", "impact_on_term_of_interest": "A biographer of Donald Trump predicts that his tariff policies will have a devastating effect on the US economy, leading to a decline in his approval ratings as Americans feel the negative economic consequences.

The Trump administration touted the positive report on Wednesday, saying \u201cthe economy is moving in the right direction under President Trump,\u201d according to a statement from the White House. Reining in decades-high inflation was expected to be a slow and bumpy process. And readings have been a little choppy in recent months, prompting the central bank to take a more cautious approach to rate cuts in 2025. A receipt was sent to your email. However, the underlying trends and ongoing disinflationary progress seen in sticky areas like services, particularly shelter, could help to offset some of the tariff-driven increases on the goods side of the equation, she said. Despite some of the recent undulations, economists \u2014 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell \u2014 have noted that the underlying data continues to show that the pace of price hikes is slowing.

The Dow gained 140 points, or 0.3%, before dropping by around 300 points. The S&P 500 rose by 1.1% in early morning trading and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.9% higher, though both later pared those gains. Egg prices, which have soared because an ongoing bout of avian flu is ravaging the industry, rose 10.4% for the month, a cooler reading than the 15.2% increase logged in January. Still, egg prices remain high, up 58.8% from a year ago. The steel and aluminum tariffs as well as additional tariffs levied on Canada and Mexico are expected to drive up the prices of new and used vehicles. The impact is likely to be more pronounced in the March CPI data, Sohn noted. Food and fuel are two of the most frequent ways that consumers encounter inflation, and those prices can fluctuate wildly on a month-by-month basis. That\u2019s due to factors such as weather, war, disease, supply chain snarls, spikes in demand or other temporary shocks.

One of the key contributors is the impact of tariffs, which have started to influence consumer prices.\u201d February\u2019s core CPI came in better than expected as well, rising 0.2% for the month (from 0.4% in January) and slowing to 3.1% annually from 3.2%.

Updated: March 12, 2025 @ 11:00 am Plus, a good chunk of the CPI is a very lagged indicator of what\u2019s happening in critical parts of the economy. The tariff policy has been frenetic, making it challenging for consumers, businesses and economists to truly gauge potential impacts. As it stands now, Wells Fargo economists expect the headline CPI to increase to 3.2% by the third quarter. BLS\u2019 measurement of housing-related prices is a very lagged and amorphous process (including estimating the rental value of owner-occupied homes). But in recent months, the shelter index has better reflected the slower, if not flat or falling, rent hikes seen in real life. \u201cFamiliar problem areas,\u201d such as high, but slowing, housing-related inflation, continue to exert pressure on household budgets, noted Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. Thank you. Eggs represent a small share of the overall Consumer Price Index, at 0.15%, but they can have an outsized impact with a large increase. \u201cMy colleague Sarah House has a good phrase on this: \u2018Inflation is a process,\u2019\u201d Cervi said. \u201cA lot of it is reflecting past business decisions and how that\u2019s being reflected in prices.\u201d The Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes across commonly purchased goods and services, was 2.8% for the 12 months ended in February, a cooldown from the 3% annual rate notched in January, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2%, versus 0.5% in January. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a delta, probably closer to a percentage point higher of where we would be in the absence of all of this tariff policy,\u201d Nicole Cervi, Wells Fargo economist, told CNN in an interview. The-CNN-Wire \u201cThe moderation that we\u2019re seeing in shelter, a lot of that is reflecting rental price deceleration that we saw last year, even toward the end of 2023,\u201d she said. (CNN) \u2014 Inflation slowed more than expected in February and cooled for the first time in five months, but that progress may be short lived as President Donald Trump ramps up his trade war, which threatens to increase prices for Americans. A 10% tariff imposed on Chinese goods went into effect in February, and some retailers likely raised prices preemptively, Sohn noted.

Steel pipes, necessary for the oil and construction industries, will also be affected. An increase in prices is also expected for orders of metal structures and steel bars, used in the manufacture of machinery and industrial components. Exports of steel, aluminum, and derivatives to the United States are primarily located in states with manufacturing profiles in the northern and central regions of Mexico. The state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n exports 36% of total steel and aluminum to the U.S. market, followed by Coahuila with 13%, Baja California with 8.6%, and Tamaulipas with 7.9%. Across the Rio Grande, demand for Mexican steel is centered in Texas, Illinois, and California. If anything has become clear in Donald Trump\u2019s 50 days in office, it\u2019s that his threats\u2014especially regarding tariffs\u2014aren\u2019t always carried out. The 25% tariff on aluminum and steel imports did go into effect after midnight on Tuesday, Washington time. But it\u2019s unclear, given what we\u2019ve seen, for how long, or whether the time-consuming negotiations between his neighbors and main trading partners, Mexico and Canada, will succeed, as they have several times in recent weeks, in lifting them, or at the very least in delaying them. The tariffs will affect around $150 billion in imported consumer products, according to Bloomberg. \u00bfTienes una suscripci\u00f3n de empresa? Accede aqu\u00ed para contratar m\u00e1s cuentas. Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition Trump\u2019s erratic and untimely nature complicates forecasts; however, the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO) has estimated that exports affected by these new tariffs will exceed $29 billion in value. In its analysis, it indicates that the tariffs on the targeted products will impact 4.7% of total Mexican exports, due to the inclusion of essential goods for the automotive, electronics, and household appliance sectors. \u201cThe inclusion of vehicle parts and accessories in these measures directly impacts the automotive sector, one of the country\u2019s main export sectors,\u201d the association states in its document. But Canada is no ordinary country. Not only because of the strong economic and social ties that bind it to the United States, which are now being shattered by the annexation aspirations of the new White House resident, who wants to make Canada the 51st state of the Union, but also because Canada is the largest exporter of steel and aluminum to the United States. The top five steel suppliers to the United States in January were Canada ($11.2 billion), followed by Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, and Germany. As for aluminum, Canada once again tops the list, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and China, all a considerable distance behind.

The tariffs went into effect at the end of another chaotic day at the White House. Tuesday had begun with the news that the U.S. president was planning to double the announced tariffs on aluminum and steel, but only for Canada, in retaliation for the previous day\u2019s announcement that the province of Ontario had decided to add a 25% surcharge on the price of electricity it sells to the states of Michigan, Minnesota, and New York. Trump\u2019s aggressive measure led Ontario authorities to backtrack, and things returned to the original plan: that Canada would only face a 25% tariff, the same percentage as other countries. Suscr\u00edbete y lee sin l\u00edmites All eyes will once again be on market performance this Wednesday, now that the steel and aluminum tariffs, which Trump signed by executive order on February 13, have gone into effect. These aren\u2019t the only tariffs underway: the trade war with China escalated a couple of weeks ago with the imposition of a 10% tariff on imports from the Asian giant, which responded with reciprocal tariffs. Trump\u2019s tariff back-and-forth caused markets to plummet on Monday amid fears of a U.S. recession triggered by the White House\u2019s aggressive and volatile trade policy. It was the worst day so far this year for the stock market, also due to the U.S. president\u2019s failure to clearly rule out on two occasions\u2014in an interview on Fox News and in response to a reporter\u2019s question on board Air Force One\u2014the possibility that the country was heading toward a recession.

On Monday, the S&P 500 index had lost 2.7%. While stocks posted gains in the early stages of trading, the retaliation against Canada turned the market on its head, and even Trump\u2019s reversal failed to assuage investor sentiment. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed the trading day with a slight loss of 0.18%. The more traditional Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, gave up 1.1%, while the S&P 500 retreated 0.76%. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 est\u00e1s viendo esto? Now, the controversial measure is based on the United States\u2019 trade deficit in this sector. However, in Mexico\u2019s case, this justification does not apply, as the balance of trade is in favor of the United States by more than $6.8 billion, according to official figures. Mexican Secretary of Economy Marcelo Ebrard has argued since his first term that the imposition of tariffs \u201cis unfair.\u201d The Mexican steel industry has joined in rejecting this measure, arguing that this tariff wall puts 75% of Mexican steel exports, valued at $2.1 billion, at risk and jeopardizes investments in the sector. \u201cIf we fail to achieve the exclusion of Mexican steel from this measure, it will be necessary to apply reciprocal retaliation against U.S. steel products,\u201d they said in a statement. The U.S. tariff threat on steel and aluminum exports is not new to Mexico and Canada. In June 2018, during his first term, the Republican imposed a tariff of between 10% and 25% on these goods. Although the tariffs were only in effect for a year and were then eliminated, last July the Biden administration once again targeted these strategic supplies due to an unusual increase in shipments and the suspicion that Mexico was being used by China as a gateway into the United States. At that time, the U.S. government tightened trade requirements by requiring companies to prove that the exported steel was being melted and poured in North America if they wanted to avoid paying a tariff.", "https://www.benzinga.com/general/market-summary/25/03/44256598/hedges-become-profitable-trump-stock-market-put-failed-trump-has-bigger-fish-to-fry": "After the sell off, consider taking partial profits on hedges.

Machinery and vehicles are the biggest European exports to the U.S., followed by chemicals and pharmaceutical products. Commodities Currencies The European Union (EU) has retaliated against U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum imports from the continent. The European tariffs apply to industrial-grade steel and aluminum, other steel and aluminum products, and derivative commercial products such as machinery parts. Unlike Mexico, Canada and China, Europe had not been hit by Trump\u2019s tariffs until now. European Commission data shows that the overall EU / U.S. trade in goods and services in 2023 totaled $1.68 trillion. Indices The EU has hit back with its own counter measures, saying the European bloc needs to protect domestic consumers and businesses. Trump confirmed 25% duties on all steel and aluminum imports, which apply to not only Europe but to Canada and Australia as well. Stocks However, Trump backed down on an earlier threat to impose tariffs of up to 50% on metals from Canada. The European Union has responded quickly, imposing counter-tariffs on 26 billion euros ($28.33 billion) worth of American goods starting in April. The EU\u2019s approach will see previously suspended tariffs re-imposed on eight billion euros of U.S. imports, and a slew of new countermeasures on 18 billion euros of goods in a move the EU leadership described as \u201cstrong but proportionate\u201d in a news release.", "https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-retailer-big-box-stocks-selloff-consumer-spending-strength-recession-2025-3": "Month-to-month sales fell 0.22% in February, excluding automobiles and gasoline, according to the CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor. Even before this year's economic uncertainty caused recessionary fears to spike, consumers were already signaling lower spending intentions in the first quarter. Meanwhile, disappointing earnings projections from Dick's pushed the athletic retailer's stock down almost 6% in Tuesday's session. Monday marked the index's most painful day this year \u2014 among notable losers were stocks exposed to consumer lending, such American Express, Capital One, and Discover. Both are just the latest examples in a string of downbeat consumer signals. Last month, retail stocks were rocked by Walmart's underwhelming fiscal year outlook, suggesting a looming spending unwind. The notion of a spending pullback has ripped into the stock market over recent weeks, adding to economic pressures that have pushed the benchmark S&P 500 index to drop 9.4% from a February high. Kohl's sank 23% by around midday on Tuesday. For the full year, the retailer expects net sales to drop 5%-7%. Earnings per share are forecast between $0.10-$0.60, well below consensus estimates. Airlines and retailers are the latest casualties of mounting calls for a weaker consumer as Wall Street positions for a possible economic slowdown. A growing number of firms are signaling a weaker outlook for US consumer spending, putting a key pillar of economic support in focus for investors this year. Disappointing outlooks from a range of companies show expectations for strong consumer spending have ebbed after years of US shoppers helping to prop up the post-pandemic economy. Jump to Delta, Southwest, and Jet Blue each cited macroeconomic uncertainty as a leading reason for lowered earnings forecasts this week. A weaker outlook for travel demand has slashed first-quarter revenue expectations. Delta fell as much as 8.7% Tuesday morning. While Americans' buying spree has been a source of economic and market strength since 2022, consumer endurance is petering out: stubborn inflation, high interest rates, and the threat of tariffs are pushing spenders into a cost-saving mentality. Losses, though, have been even heavier among big-box retailers that are seeing a similar slowdown in consumer spending.", "https://www.aol.com/finance/stretch-financial-wellness-150407266.html": "AOL Financial education: Learn what you need to know with easy-to-understand info designed to boost your financial confidence and knowledge. Choosing the right budgeting app starts with understanding your financial needs and habits. To determine if Stretch is a fit for you, consider these questions: In-app notifications: Through text or email, Stretch provides reminders about financial goals and payments. Debt management focus: Unlike some general budgeting apps, Stretch provides specific tools for monitoring and reducing debt, including credit score visibility. That said, Stretch isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution for financial planning or budgeting. While it offers helpful features, there are some limitations to consider. The competitive budgeting app landscape includes alternatives like You Need a Budget (YNAB) and PocketGuard, which offer similar benefits at comparable price points. Stretch aims to differentiate itself from standard budgeting apps by offering more comprehensive tools for financial management. While budgeting apps are plentiful, Stretch offers several useful features: Before committing, you can take advantage of Stretch\u2019s free trial period to determine if its features align with your financial management style. This hands-on experience will reveal whether the app\u2019s interface, notification system and debt-tracking capabilities provide genuine value for your situation. Does Stretch charge fees for its features? The app provides tools to help users understand their financial situation, plan for the future and work toward personal financial goals. It approaches financial management by breaking down complex concepts into more manageable steps and providing actionable insights. Are budgeting apps trustworthy? Financial wellness extends beyond money management \u2014 it\u2019s about having the freedom to make choices that improve your quality of life without constant financial worry. Whether handling unexpected expenses or saving for long-term goals, financial wellness provides greater control over your money and increased peace of mind. Can Stretch help pay off credit card debt? Customized goal setting: Define and track goals like saving for an emergency fund, staying within a budget or paying off debt. Stretch includes features for tracking debt, monitoring credit scores and creating payment plans that may help with credit card debt management. Stretch offers these key features: But there\u2019s good news: Working toward financial goals, such as debt reduction or emergency fund building, typically correlates with increased confidence and security regardless of income level. Financial wellness creates stability that can improve overall quality of life. Though marketed as a comprehensive financial wellness tool, Stretch may not adequately serve those with complex financial situations due to its limited personalization and absence of human advisor support. Stretch Financial Wellness (simply known as \u201cStretch\u201d) aims to take financial management further by focusing on where your money can take you rather than just showing how you spend it. Let\u2019s examine Stretch\u2019s features, benefits and limitations to help you determine if it\u2019s right for your financial goals. Centralized dashboard: The Vision subscription allows users to link banking accounts, credit cards and various debts including student loans, car loans and mortgages. If you\u2019re particularly focused on debt management and benefit from real-time feedback, Stretch\u2019s comprehensive dashboard might justify its $12.99 monthly subscription cost. The app can serve as a middle ground between basic free budgeting tools and more expensive financial advisory services. Real-time insights: Get up-to-date notifications on your spending and savings so you can adjust in the moment. Financial marketplace: Users can explore financial products from selected institutions, including credit cards, loans, bank accounts and more. The 2024 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index shows that financial literacy in the U.S. has remained at about 50 percent for eight years, with a 2 percent decline in the past two years. This knowledge gap often leads to financial decisions that can make progress difficult. Advertisement This financial literacy gap is reflected in Americans\u2019 saving habits. According to\u00a0Bankrate\u2019s 2024 Emergency Savings Report, 32 percent of consumers have less money in savings than they did a year ago, and 9 percent say they have no savings at all. In these cases, you might be better served by financial planning software with more advanced features, consulting with a financial advisor, or using free spreadsheet templates designed for budgeting. Would real-time spending insights and reminders help you make better financial decisions? Reputable budgeting apps typically employ secure encryption and follow privacy standards to protect financial data. Before signing up for any financial service, verify its security features and privacy policy. Users with debt from smaller lenders using less advanced technology may find that Stretch doesn\u2019t fully integrate with these institutions. Similarly, those managing finances across multiple countries will likely find the app insufficient for their needs, as Stretch isn\u2019t designed to handle international financial complexities. Stretch Financial Wellness is an app designed to help users manage their finances with a focus on debt management, real-time insights and guidance for making financial progress. Do you need guidance to develop better financial habits but don\u2019t want to hire a financial advisor? Is debt management (especially credit cards) a primary financial goal for you? Have basic budgeting apps failed to give you the structure and motivation you need? For premium support please call: The $12.99 monthly fee for the Vision subscription may be counterproductive for budget-conscious users, especially since the free version only supports one credit card. Considering the average American has 3.84 credit cards, many users would need to upgrade to the paid plan for full functionality. In behavioral economics, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cnudging\u201d \u2014 small, thoughtful prompts that help us make better decisions without being intrusive. Budgeting apps often claim to be that nudge, but not all of them deliver. Some simply log your spending after the fact, while others try to guide you toward smarter money habits in real time. Financial stress affects more than your bank account. According to the American Psychological Association, 63 percent of Americans cite money as a significant source of stress. This stress can impact mental health, daily functioning and even physical wellbeing. Do you prefer having all your accounts \u2014 loans, credit cards and savings \u2014 visible in one dashboard? Categorized spending insights: The app organizes spending into categories to help users understand spending patterns and make adjustments. If you answered yes to most of these questions, Stretch could be beneficial. However, consider alternative solutions if you have complex financial circumstances requiring personalized advice, manage finances across international borders, are already comfortable using spreadsheets or other low-cost alternatives, or find that the subscription cost doesn\u2019t fit your budget. Stretch offers a 7-day free trial, after which the Vision subscription costs $9.99 monthly for the first three months with promotional code SAVE3FOR3. Regular pricing is $12.99 monthly. Stretch does have notable advantages, including its user-friendly interface, emphasis on progress over perfection and the ability to make payments directly through the app. Unlike some competitors, it offers a free version, albeit with significant limitations.", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-12/skepticism-for-us-stocks-deepens-as-goldman-cuts-s-p-500-target": "For inquiries related to this message please contactour support team and provide the reference ID below.

They are also monitoring how it will be seen by countries outside the US and by market players.

Tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump will have a devastating effect in the US economy, according to one of his biographers Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Kelly and Germania will be joined by a regular cast of commentators, political insiders, and former Trump staffers for a three times weekly run down on the world\u2019s biggest, most powerful soap opera. Search Welcome to MAGAland wherever you get your podcasts now. 'Donald believes that tariffs are paid by foreign countries, even though that's ridiculous,' the former New York Times reporter said on Monday, adding that it will be the American consumer who will pay for the tariffs. His commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has said one of Trump's goals with tariffs is to abolish the income tax and the IRS and have foreign countries pay for US services instead. President Trump has shocked economists as he continues to double down on tariffs on Canada and Mexico; on Tuesday he said he would\u00a0double the planned tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 percent for Canada, escalating the trade war as a response to the price increases Ontario put on electricity sold to the US. He then added, 'It takes a little time. It takes a little time.' 'Donald's tariff plan harkens back to the era in the United States in the late 18th and the 19th centuries when the government was very small and tariffs were a way to build up the economic muscle of domestic manufacturers,' Johnston said of Trump's economic policy. 'Donald is a con artist at heart. He's very good at it. He\u00a0has millions of people persuaded that his plan will make us rich. It's not possible for that to happen - the\u00a0actions he's taken cannot a lead to enormous wealth except for a relatively small number of people at the very top.' The biographer predicted that Trump's approval rating will suffer once the effects of tariffs start to bite. Welcome to MAGAland: The brand new politics podcast bringing you the latest news and gossip from Trump insiders. New episodes every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The economy has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism. And a widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the US economy may already be shrinking. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 890 points, or 2.1 percent, after paring an earlier loss of more than 1,100, while the Nasdaq composite skidded by 4percent. It was the worst day yet in a scary stretch where the S&P 500 has swung more than 1 percent, up or down, seven times in eight days because of Trump\u2019s on -and- off -again tariffs. The president has promised his economic plan will make America so rich 'you\u2019re not going to know where to spend all that money.' Welcome to MAGALand podcast: Pulitzer prize winner David Cay Johnston, a longtime Trump critic, says Americans could start feeling the effects of tariffs as soon as this summer Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group But on Monday the US\u00a0stock market had its worst day in three years as Wall Street questioned how much pain President Trump will let the economy endure through tariffs and other policies in order to get what he wants. Pulitzer prize winner David Cay Johnston, a longtime Trump critic who has written several books about him, spoke about Trump's 'disastrous' economic policy in the latest episode of DailyMail's new podcast, Welcome to Magaland. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7 percent to drag it close to 9 percent below its all-time high, which was set just last month. At one point, the S&P 500 was down 3.6 percent and on track for its worst day since 2022. That\u2019s when the highest inflation in generations was shredding budgets and raising worries about a possible recession that ultimately never came. 'Donald's ratings will continue to be good until people discover his economics are not good for them,' he said. I think it's going to be a while, but I won't be surprised if as early as summer we begin to see Americans souring and saying, \"wait a minute, what's going on here?\"' Trump has expressed admiration for the Gilded Age economy and president William McKinlye, who imposed heavy tariffs as the US economy was growing a century ago, before the US had an income tax. Asked over the weekend whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News: 'I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing.' 46 Published:  15:52 EDT, 11 March 2025   |  Updated:  16:35 EDT, 11 March 2025 By GERMANIA RODRIGUEZ POLEO, CHIEF U.S. REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM White House-insiders Kelly Laco and Germania Rodriguez bring you the latest from the heart of the Trump administration in the way that only dailymail.com can: the gossip; the scandals; the fashion; the family; the accusations; and \u2013 of course \u2013 the biggest political news stories of the day.

This\u00a0revision came after\u00a0a downward revision in GDP expectations due to a projected 10-percentage-point tariff-rate increase.

The S&P 500 briefly slipped into correction territory in the last session, however, it managed to recover soon after. Beyond earnings, Goldman also trimmed its valuation multiple to 20.6 times projected earnings from 21.5, citing elevated uncertainty and tightening fiscal conditions. While the impact of uncertainty on valuations is usually short-lived, slower growth could sustain lower valuations for a longer period.

With that, Goldman Sachs slashed its 2025 target for the S&P 500 to 6,200, down from the earlier 6,500. Now while Goldman Sachs was the first to go ahead and cut its S&P 500 target, others like Citi had recently downgraded its rating for US equities to a 'neutral'. Much like Goldman Sachs, Citi also based its decision on recession fears and weakening economic momentum. However, the revised estimates also\u00a0assumes an eventual market recovery, projecting the S&P 500 at 6,200, which is 11 percent higher than the previous close.

US markets saw another session of losses on Tuesday (Mar 11) amid more trade uncertainties, as the president halted a plan to double US tariffs on Canadian steel and metal imports to 50 per cent just hours after first threatening them.

SINGAPORE: Concerns over US tariffs have triggered volatility on Wall Street, but this does\u00a0not mean that Asia\u2019s stock markets will be in for a similarly rough ride, analysts said. \u201cThese will aid to counter a potential drop off in tariff-sensitive exports from the ongoing trade war,\u201d Mr Aw said. \u201cWhat started with a decline in expensive tech stocks \u2026 has given way to a broad-based equity sell-off as the looming threat of extended trade wars and softer economic data stoked fears of recession,\u201d said Mr Tim Murray, a capital markets specialist at T Rowe Price. As tariffs will inevitably be bad news for the region\u2019s export-oriented economies, analysts said cautious sentiment will likely persist in Asian markets until a clearer picture emerges of the extent and severity of tariffs \u2013 both by the US and other countries in retaliation \u2013 that will be implemented. Mr Zane Aw, research analyst at Phillip Securities Research, said the latest sell-off could potentially be the \u201cend of the bull run\u201d on Wall Street given factors such as expensive valuations and recent sluggish economic data.

But the trio of local banks - DBS, OCBC and UOB - which have been investors\u2019 favourites, may no longer be as attractive given the high valuations that may limit upside potential.

These include new immigration rules, government layoffs, and tariffs on imported goods. Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration thinks the economy will be okay and that any short-term problems will be followed by growth. However, Summers disagrees, and said that the administration\u2019s policies will ultimately hurt the economy. He also thinks that the Fed\u2019s efforts to cut interest rates might not be enough to help the economy grow. Commodities Currencies Indices Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers thinks there\u2019s an almost 50% that the U.S. will enter into a recession this year. He believes this is because of changes made by the Trump administration and uncertainty in the markets. Indeed, Summers says that the U.S. has a big problem with uncertainty, and it won\u2019t be easy to fix. This uncertainty is making it hard for businesses to make decisions and for consumers to feel confident about spending money.

He says that while protectionism might seem like a good idea in the short term, it usually ends up hurting the economy in the long term. Summers also thinks that businesses are too uncertain about what will happen next to invest in new projects or hire new employees, which will make it hard for the economy to grow.", "https://www.aol.com/finance/goldman-sachs-cuts-p-500-135231693.html": "AOL \"We lower our 2025 year-end S&P 500 index target to 6200 (from 6500) to reflect a 4% reduction in our modeled fair-value forward P/E multiple (20.6x from 21.5x),\" Kostin and his team wrote.

His words serve as a warning about the unintended consequences of passive investing. When a few firms control voting rights across much of corporate America, decisions that impact millions of investors and workers end up in the hands of a small group of executives.

Its top 10 holdings make up just under 50% of its assets. QQQ\u2019s top 10 holdings feature some of the market\u2019s biggest and best-known names, whether magnificent-7 stocks like Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) or other powerhouses like Costco (COST) and Netflix (NFLX). These blue-chip growth stocks represent many of the world\u2019s best and most innovative companies, making them an attractive proposition for long-term shareholders. Stocks Following the sharp decline, I\u2019m bullish on the Nasdaq-tracking ETF based on its stellar long-term track record, diversified portfolio of blue-chip growth stocks, and reasonable expense ratio. As an added bonus, while things have been painful in the short term, Wall St. analysts forecast a potential upside of almost 30% for QQQ over the next 12 months. Market selloffs are never fun in the short term. But newer investors and investors with a long-term time horizon can be a blessing in disguise, as they offer a chance to add strong investments like QQQ to their portfolios at significantly lower price points. Many investors and individuals on the sidelines have been wishing they had bought these stocks earlier or when they were cheaper, so the present situation seems like a good chance to do just that. Let\u2019s also look at QQQ\u2019s performance from a cumulative perspective to illustrate its appeal to long-term investors. As of February 28, QQQ generated a cumulative three-year return of 49.5%, meaning an investor who put $10,000 into the fund three years ago would have $14,950 three years later. Going out even further, the results are even more pronounced. QQQ\u2019s five-year cumulative return stands at an even more impressive 155%, so an investor putting $10,000 into QQQ five years ago would have an investment worth $25,497 five years later. On a ten-year horizon, QQQ\u2019s phenomenal cumulative return of 407.4% means that an investor putting $10,000 into QQQ 10 years ago would have a position worth over $50,000 today. I remain firmly bullish on QQQ based on its exemplary performance over the years, its portfolio of blue-chip growth stocks, and its moderate expense ratio. While the market could still head lower from here in the short term, investors who look past short-term pain and take advantage of fearful sellers will be thankful in the long term. Disclosure Indices It goes without saying that market selloffs never feel particularly good for investors. The ongoing slide in tech stocks continues, with the Nasdaq index down 12% from its all-time high. However, newer investors and those investing in the long term can have a good opportunity to add great names to their portfolios at discounted prices, which benefits them in the long run.\u00a0One great example during the current tech sell-off is the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF, now down 12.9% from its all-time high and 7.5% lower year-to-date. As an added bonus for long-term investors and those just starting a position now, many of these names are considerably cheaper and trading at lower prices than just a few weeks ago. For example, Alphabet (GOOGL) trades in correction territory, down 19.9% from its 52-week high, and trades at a below-market multiple of just 18.5x forward earnings estimates. Similarly, while skeptics have questioned Nvidia\u2019s expensive valuation over the past few years, the stock is now down 30% from its 52-week highs and trades at an incredibly reasonable valuation of just 23.8x forward earnings estimates. Commodities Moreover, Invesco\u2019s ETF pays dividends and offers a modest 0.6% dividend yield, albeit below the sector average of 1.2%. Most recent reported figures indicate that the QQQ ETF pays $0.83 in dividends per share. At last month\u2019s close, QQQ reported a three-year annualized return of 14.4%. Moreover, the fund has posted a stellar five-year annualized return of 20.6% and an impeccable 10-year annualized return of 17.6%. These remarkable returns mean that it has beaten the broader market over each of these time frames \u2014 for comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 (SPX), posted strong annualized returns of 12.4% over the past three years, 16.6% over the past five years, and 12.8% over the past 10 years. These are strong returns but still trail those of QQQ over each time horizon. Currencies With over $300 billion in assets under management, QQQ is today\u2019s fifth-largest ETF in the stock market. The fund, launched in 1999, tracks the Nasdaq-100 (NDX) index, providing investors access to the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. Because of the Nasdaq-100\u2019s tech\u2014and growth-centric nature, the fund skews towards large-cap growth and tech stocks, although this isn\u2019t its explicit strategy. QQQ earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 89 Buys, 13 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst QQQ price target of $605.31 implies a 28.3% upside potential from current levels over the next twelve months. While past performance does not guarantee future results, QQQ has established itself as a long-term winner and an investment that has consistently beaten the broader market and generated significant wealth for its investors over a long time horizon. That makes it easy to see why the current weakness over the past month should be considered a buying opportunity for long-term investors. When looking at QQQ\u2019s long-term track record, it\u2019s easy to see why both retail and institutional investors love this fund. Over the past year, Invesco QQQ has delivered 443% greater returns than the S&P 500. Therefore, despite QQQ being down 10% this month, its past performance demonstrates that any sell-offs tend to be decent buying opportunities, allowing investors to gain exposure to a proven fund with stable returns at lower prices.", "https://stocknews.com/news/spy-inx-dia-iwm-qqq-has-the-next-bear-market-already-arrived/": " At this stage the odds point to this being no more than a well deserved correction after 2 years of tremendous gains. Likely we soon will hit a point of capitulation with a lasting bounce to follow So a lot of the recent action is about letting some air out of that balloon with the PE for Mega Caps down to 26 from a previous 32. Still high\u2026but more palatable. 3 Stocks to DOUBLE This Year Steve is better known to the StockNews audience as \u201cReity\u201d. Not only is he the CEO of the firm, but he also shares his 40 years of investment experience in the Reitmeister Total Return portfolio. Learn more about Reity\u2019s background, along with links to his most recent articles and stock picks. More... 2 times it became a full blown bear market (2020 & 2022). But another 3 times it went down a lot more and ALMOST became bear markets (2011, 2015, 2018). We have long been told that a break below the 200 day moving average is a serious problem for the stock market. So I did some research today to find out how often a break below this key level foreshadows a new bear market. That led me to the following vital information: Remember the average bear market equates to a 34% drop from previous top to bottom. If that were the case now, we would be talking about retreating to about 4,000. Meaning we would not be too late to the party to take action. Now add in my 44 years of investing experience seeing bull markets\u2026bear markets\u2026and everything between. This helps me pick the right stocks for the current environment. First, we find that only 2 of the last 15 breaks below the 200 day moving average resulted in a bear market. That provides a big sigh of relief because I thought it was going to be worse than that with higher probability of a bear on the prowl. Market Outlook As pointed out, too many times to count, the large caps have topped their smaller peers for 4 years in a row. In particular, the Mag 7 stocks, which got overinflated. TSLA being the poster child for this irrational exuberance. However, the longer stocks stay below\u2026the more it increases the odds of a lot more downside to come. LoginJoin On the other hand, if things keep devolving (staying under 200 day too long and/or increased odds of recession) then we will prepare for bear market. That includes selling off more of our aggressive positions to first raise cash\u2026then redeploy into inverse ETFs to make more money as the bear market takes hold and stocks trend much lower. So what will happen this time around? As shared in other recent commentary, it is hard to be a bear when tax cuts may soon be on the way. That is especially true if the tax cuts are for corporations given this chain reaction: This begs the obvious question; Are we headed towards a bear market? SPY \u2013 The recent break below the 200 day moving average for the S&P 500 (SPY) has a lot of investors worried that the next bear market has already arrived. Investment expert Steve Reitmeister shares his timely views along with a trading plan to stay on the right side of the action. And here is the more complete answer. What To Do Next? Steve\u00a0Reitmeister\u2026but everyone calls me Reity (pronounced \u201cRighty\u201d)Editor, Reitmeister Total Return On top of that you have all large caps now closer to 20 PE and small and mid caps a quite appealing 15.

Mar 12, 2025 Long story short, my eyes are wide open to either possibility unfolding and ready to act. Hopefully this commentary has you at the ready as well. However, it does very much have us on high alert that things could get worse\u2026as in devolve into the next bear market. Short answer = maybe Meaning that 5 out of 15 times it paid to get more defensive as stocks had a lot more downside action following the 200 day breakdown. My gut tells me that few Presidents are more aware of the stock market than Trump given how many times he talked about the height of the market during his first administration. Thus, I think he will either soften his tone on tariffs and/or start talking more about tax cuts as a means to settle the nerves of investors. I will share my answer to that vital question, and what that means for our trading plan in today\u2019s Reitmeister Total Return commentary All the stocks have been selected using the proven outperformance that comes from our POWR Ratings stock selection model which has done 4X better than the S&P 500 since 1999.

On top of that we find that in recent days the S&P 500 and tech heavy Nasdaq are down the most with small caps outperforming. That flies in the face of a traditional Risk Off market where smaller stocks fall much more than their larger counterparts. This is definitely one of the more confusing times for investors in recent memory. Gladly having helpful stats like the chart shown above has us not be too overreactive to the recent break below the 200 day moving average. Lower corporate taxes > higher EPS > higher stock prices (Yellow = 50 Day Moving Average / Orange = 100 Day MA / Red = 200 Day MA) In that case, we will put more of our cash stock pile to use in the most attractive POWR Ratings stocks for the next leg higher. Here is the current chart of the S&P 500 showing the break below the 200 day moving average on Monday. The S&P 500 (SPY) violently broke below the 200 day moving average on Monday and now has stayed below for a 2nd straight session. As long as the economy avoids recession and investors become reacquainted with Trumps unique style of implementing policy (like tariffs)\u2026then we should soon bounce back above the 200 day moving average putting bear market fears to rest. I could make a convincing case for both bull or bear\u2026and thus am prepared for either outcome. That certainly was the case when this was last served up back in 2017 and the S&P 500 rallied +19.42% on the year. I would expect it would be equally beneficial this time around. Wishing you a world of investment success! SPY shares were trading at $557.01 per share on Tuesday afternoon, down $3.57 (-0.64%). Year-to-date, SPY has declined -4.96%, versus a % rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. Second, the key is how long you stay under the 200 day moving average. It appears that most resolve within 2 weeks with a break back above this key level.", "https://www.benzinga.com/etfs/broad-u-s-equity-etfs/25/03/44275083/how-to-trade-spy-and-tech-leaders-as-market-focuses-on-cpi-data": "Apple Inc.

DAILY-EVENING Short-Term Impact vs. Long-Term AI-led Growth This is bad news for the $283 billion Indian IT industry, which saw the healthiest recovery in 18 months in the third quarter of FY25 (Q3FY25) ended December 31, 2024, after a prolonged period of slowdown for several quarters at a stretch. Additionally, Everest Group believes there are green shoots for the services sector despite the recessionary concerns such as the GCC opportunity and the smaller companies outside Fortune 500 which have significant transformation needs. Follow us on: Consequently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the broader S&P 500 have fallen to their lowest levels since September 2024. Back home, the Nifty IT index has dropped approximately 16 percent so far this year. Most of the revenues for IT companies originate from the North American market, and a recession in this market weighs heavily on the topline and bottomline. Further, with the new technology cycle ongoing, analysts believe there\u2019s a likelihood of a \"transition phase\" as spending gets re-prioritised and growth rates moderate for a prolonged period. On March 12, Nifty IT was down nearly 2 percent in early trade, marking its lowest level since July 2024, after brokerage firm Morgan Stanley's latest report highlighted growing risks for the sector due to evolving global macroeconomic conditions and rapid technological shifts.

While AI investments and cost-efficiency measures could eventually revive spending, Indian IT firms will have to wade through a volatile global environment before discretionary IT budgets fully recover. AI-driven transformation remains a structural growth opportunity, Arora argues. \u201cIf there is some stability in the business environment and rates are cut, then there is the possibility of change in sentiments and acceleration in discretionary spending,\u201d Jain further added.

News18 Firstpost CNBC TV18 News18 Hindi Cricketnext Overdrive Topper Learning Home Currencies Commodities Pre-Market IPO Global Market Bonds Revival of discretionary spending by clients of Indian information technology (IT) firms is expected to be further delayed as fears mount of a US recession triggered by potential tariff actions under the Trump administration. \u201cPost the uncertainty regarding tariffs and the broader geo-political environment, we find ourselves in a situation of decision paralysis. This is one of the worst things that happens to the sectors because clients don\u2019t say yes or no but simply defer the decision on big initiatives because that is the safe thing to do,\u201d Jinit Arora, CEO, of consulting firm Everest Group, told Moneycontrol. Moreover, Indian IT companies are closely dependent on the US economy, and such uncertainty can affect their decision-making, according to Piyush Pandey, SVP - Institutional Equity Research (Lead Analyst) at the broking firm Centrum. \u201cCompanies are moving towards \u2018Systems of Action,\u2019 a new wave of AI-powered process transformation that will drive demand for services in integration, engineering, data, and talent transformation.

Although insurers have attempted to curb these rising costs by steering patients toward lower-cost care options, such as at-home treatments, the growing number of new drugs in the pipeline for 2025 suggests that pharmaceutical expenses will remain a key challenge for the industry. The commercial health insurance segment, however, performed well in 2023, with a 75% increase in underwriting gains compared to the previous year, fuelled by a rise in premium revenue from the individual market. In Medicaid, insurers anticipated a decline in enrollment after redeterminations resumed in 2023, but the majority of disenrolled members were healthier individuals. Pharmaceutical costs also remain a significant concern, driven by an increase in the use of expensive drugs such as biosimilars, gene therapies, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) medications. All content copyright \u00a9 Steve Evans Ltd. 2025 All rights reserved. Steve Evans Ltd. registered in England No. 07337195Website Privacy & Cookies and Disclaimer Yet, the health insurance sector as a whole saw a significant drop in underwriting gains, with a 65% decrease to $17.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period the previous year. The report attributes this decline to various factors, including inadequate pricing adjustments in the Medicare Advantage segment. \u201cMedicaid is a more capital-intensive product, which has higher charges when calculating risk-adjusted capital. However, this has been somewhat offset by continued growth in individual Affordable Care Act products and MA,\u201d commented Sally Rosen, Senior Director, AM Best. We also publish Artemis.bm, the leading publisher of news, data and insight for the catastrophe bond, insurance-linked securities, reinsurance convergence, longevity risk transfer and weather risk management sectors.. We\u2019ve published and operated Artemis since its launch 20 years ago and have a readership of around 60,000 every month. Pricing for 2024 did not sufficiently factor in the uptick in medical costs from 2023 or the increased utilisation of healthcare services. Additionally, regulatory factors\u2014such as changes to Star ratings, risk adjustment payments, and reimbursement rates\u2014are expected to continue pressuring margins in the MA segment through 2025. The sharp rise in the number of people taking GLP-1 drugs has further accelerated pharmacy claims, which now represent over 13% of total medical claims. The industry recorded a net income of $31 billion for the period, but increasing medical and pharmaceutical costs have put pressure on profit margins. Looking ahead, AM Best projects that the US health insurance industry will remain profitable through the end of 2024, with similar trends continuing into 2025. AM Best, a global credit rating agency focused on the insurance industry, has released its Annual Review & Preview Best\u2019s Market Segment Report, titled \u201cUS Health Insurers Met Challenges in 2024, but Pressures Expected to Persist in 2025.\u201d The report highlights that while the US health insurance industry saw favourable operating performance through the third quarter of 2024, it faced challenges in underwriting, primarily in Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicaid managed care due to rising healthcare costs, particularly in pharmaceuticals. \u201cFor the past several years, the industry balanced lower earnings in the commercial segment with steady and increasing profitability in the government program segments, but this trend has reversed as earnings in MA and Medicaid managed care have been challenged while the commercial segment\u2019s premium trend continues to offset the narrowing margins of the several years prior,\u201d added Joseph Zazzera, Director, AM Best. Advertise on Reinsurance News 12th March 2025 - Author: Taylor Mixides - \u0394 Despite cost trends surpassing historical levels, insurers have adjusted their pricing to account for these higher costs. This proactive pricing approach is expected to sustain profitability in the commercial segment through both the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. Reinsurance News This left the remaining member population with higher health risks, increasing the cost burden. Rate hikes needed to adjust for this higher-risk population have been slower than necessary, leading to margin pressures in the Medicaid segment. We have 225,000+ readers every month & 27,000+ email subscribers. Reach the largest reinsurance audience. However, underwriting income is expected to decrease overall, primarily due to weaker results in the Medicare Advantage and Medicaid segments. The commercial segment, however, is expected to remain strong, supported by continued premium growth, the ageing of seniors into Medicare Advantage plans, and rate hikes across various product lines.", "https://www.aol.com/finance/stretch-financial-wellness-150407266.html": "Stretch offers these key features: That said, Stretch isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution for financial planning or budgeting. While it offers helpful features, there are some limitations to consider. In behavioral economics, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cnudging\u201d \u2014 small, thoughtful prompts that help us make better decisions without being intrusive. Budgeting apps often claim to be that nudge, but not all of them deliver. Some simply log your spending after the fact, while others try to guide you toward smarter money habits in real time. Stretch aims to differentiate itself from standard budgeting apps by offering more comprehensive tools for financial management. While budgeting apps are plentiful, Stretch offers several useful features: Stretch offers a 7-day free trial, after which the Vision subscription costs $9.99 monthly for the first three months with promotional code SAVE3FOR3. Regular pricing is $12.99 monthly. If you\u2019re particularly focused on debt management and benefit from real-time feedback, Stretch\u2019s comprehensive dashboard might justify its $12.99 monthly subscription cost. The app can serve as a middle ground between basic free budgeting tools and more expensive financial advisory services. Do you prefer having all your accounts \u2014 loans, credit cards and savings \u2014 visible in one dashboard? In-app notifications: Through text or email, Stretch provides reminders about financial goals and payments. Stretch includes features for tracking debt, monitoring credit scores and creating payment plans that may help with credit card debt management. Do you need guidance to develop better financial habits but don\u2019t want to hire a financial advisor? Does Stretch charge fees for its features? Can Stretch help pay off credit card debt? Would real-time spending insights and reminders help you make better financial decisions? Before committing, you can take advantage of Stretch\u2019s free trial period to determine if its features align with your financial management style. This hands-on experience will reveal whether the app\u2019s interface, notification system and debt-tracking capabilities provide genuine value for your situation. Financial stress affects more than your bank account. According to the American Psychological Association, 63 percent of Americans cite money as a significant source of stress. This stress can impact mental health, daily functioning and even physical wellbeing. Stretch Financial Wellness (simply known as \u201cStretch\u201d) aims to take financial management further by focusing on where your money can take you rather than just showing how you spend it. Let\u2019s examine Stretch\u2019s features, benefits and limitations to help you determine if it\u2019s right for your financial goals. Reputable budgeting apps typically employ secure encryption and follow privacy standards to protect financial data. Before signing up for any financial service, verify its security features and privacy policy. Financial education: Learn what you need to know with easy-to-understand info designed to boost your financial confidence and knowledge. This financial literacy gap is reflected in Americans\u2019 saving habits. According to\u00a0Bankrate\u2019s 2024 Emergency Savings Report, 32 percent of consumers have less money in savings than they did a year ago, and 9 percent say they have no savings at all. In these cases, you might be better served by financial planning software with more advanced features, consulting with a financial advisor, or using free spreadsheet templates designed for budgeting. Is debt management (especially credit cards) a primary financial goal for you? Financial wellness extends beyond money management \u2014 it\u2019s about having the freedom to make choices that improve your quality of life without constant financial worry. Whether handling unexpected expenses or saving for long-term goals, financial wellness provides greater control over your money and increased peace of mind. Stretch Financial Wellness is an app designed to help users manage their finances with a focus on debt management, real-time insights and guidance for making financial progress. Customized goal setting: Define and track goals like saving for an emergency fund, staying within a budget or paying off debt. Users with debt from smaller lenders using less advanced technology may find that Stretch doesn\u2019t fully integrate with these institutions. Similarly, those managing finances across multiple countries will likely find the app insufficient for their needs, as Stretch isn\u2019t designed to handle international financial complexities. Choosing the right budgeting app starts with understanding your financial needs and habits. To determine if Stretch is a fit for you, consider these questions: But there\u2019s good news: Working toward financial goals, such as debt reduction or emergency fund building, typically correlates with increased confidence and security regardless of income level. Financial wellness creates stability that can improve overall quality of life. Categorized spending insights: The app organizes spending into categories to help users understand spending patterns and make adjustments. AOL Though marketed as a comprehensive financial wellness tool, Stretch may not adequately serve those with complex financial situations due to its limited personalization and absence of human advisor support. Debt management focus: Unlike some general budgeting apps, Stretch provides specific tools for monitoring and reducing debt, including credit score visibility. The $12.99 monthly fee for the Vision subscription may be counterproductive for budget-conscious users, especially since the free version only supports one credit card. Considering the average American has 3.84 credit cards, many users would need to upgrade to the paid plan for full functionality. Centralized dashboard: The Vision subscription allows users to link banking accounts, credit cards and various debts including student loans, car loans and mortgages. Stretch does have notable advantages, including its user-friendly interface, emphasis on progress over perfection and the ability to make payments directly through the app. Unlike some competitors, it offers a free version, albeit with significant limitations. Are budgeting apps trustworthy? Advertisement Real-time insights: Get up-to-date notifications on your spending and savings so you can adjust in the moment. The competitive budgeting app landscape includes alternatives like You Need a Budget (YNAB) and PocketGuard, which offer similar benefits at comparable price points. For premium support please call: Financial marketplace: Users can explore financial products from selected institutions, including credit cards, loans, bank accounts and more. The app provides tools to help users understand their financial situation, plan for the future and work toward personal financial goals. It approaches financial management by breaking down complex concepts into more manageable steps and providing actionable insights. Have basic budgeting apps failed to give you the structure and motivation you need? The 2024 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index shows that financial literacy in the U.S. has remained at about 50 percent for eight years, with a 2 percent decline in the past two years. This knowledge gap often leads to financial decisions that can make progress difficult. If you answered yes to most of these questions, Stretch could be beneficial. However, consider alternative solutions if you have complex financial circumstances requiring personalized advice, manage finances across international borders, are already comfortable using spreadsheets or other low-cost alternatives, or find that the subscription cost doesn\u2019t fit your budget.", "https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/hd-hyundai-to-help-commercialise-terrapower-smr": "The signing ceremony was attended by Chung Kisun, Executive Vice Chairman of HD Hyundai; Won Kwang-shik, Head of Marine Energy Business Division at HD Hyundai Heavy Industries; Bill Gates, founder and chairman of TerraPower; Chris Levesque, president and CEO of TerraPower; and other officials. TerraPower is the first and only advanced nuclear developer with a permit application for a commercial advanced reactor submitted to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. That application was submitted in March 2024 and is on track for approval in December 2026. This partnership builds upon the relationship established in 2024 when HD Hyundai Heavy Industries was competitively selected by TerraPower to develop the cylindrical reactor vessel to be installed in the first Natrium reactor. TerraPower has announced a strategic collaboration with South Korean conglomerate HD Hyundai to expand the global manufacturing supply chain for Natrium small modular reactors, supporting the rapid commercialisation of the advanced nuclear technology. Won added: \"We expect that HD Hyundai's extensive experience and advanced technological capabilities in manufacturing will help build the foundation for commercialisation of Natrium reactors. Based on this cooperation, we will accelerate the commercialisation of next-generation nuclear energy solutions and create new growth opportunities in the global SMR market.\" The agreement with HD Hyundai Heavy Industries - an affiliate of HD Hyundai specialising in shipbuilding - creates the manufacturing foundation necessary for full-scale commercialisation beyond the initial demonstration project that is currently under development. In particular, HD Hyundai will develop optimised manufacturing processes to supply key Natrium reactor components. \"TerraPower is committed to delivering our first Natrium plant in the United States, as well as rapidly deploying additional units at competitive prices during the next decade in the US and around the world,\" said TerraPower's Levesque. \"The Natrium technology provides crucial baseload power plus gigawatt-scale energy storage; these plants will provide reliable and flexible power to address growing energy demand. HD Hyundai Heavy Industries' manufacturing capabilities are world-renowned, and I look forward to working with them to establish the commercial-scale production capacity that will be essential for successful deployment of multiple Natrium units globally.\" Natrium technology features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor using high-assay low-enriched uranium fuel, with a molten salt-based energy storage system that can boost the system's output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed. The agreement combines HD Hyundai's manufacturing expertise with TerraPower's cutting-edge reactor technology, and will build new supply chain capacity to enable large-scale production and global deployment of Natrium plants. TerraPower is constructing the Natrium demonstration plant near a retiring coal facility at Kemmerer in Wyoming. A ground-breaking ceremony held in June last year marked the start of non-nuclear construction at the site. Nuclear construction will begin after the application is approved: the company is eyeing the start of work on the nuclear island in 2026.", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/12/business/inflation-cpi-economy-new-england/": "Advertise Do Not Sell My Personal Information Gift Subscriptions Co-op Program Internship Program Digital Access Newsletters That momentum, combined with a slowing economy, could give the Federal Reserve more flexibility to lower interest rates if the economy weakens.

The increase in financial income primarily resulted from an increase in interest income from investments in marketable securities and money market funds. Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, totaled $32,005,000, or $0.76 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $19,916,000, or $0.82 per basic and diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

Craig Shore InspireMD seeks to utilize its proprietary MicroNet\u00ae technology to make its products the industry standard for carotid stenting by providing outstanding acute results and durable, stroke-free, long-term outcomes. InspireMD's common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol NSPR. For the fourth quarter of 2024, total revenue increased by $188,000, or 10.7%, to $1,949,000, from $1,761,000 during the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was predominantly driven by growth in new and existing markets. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased by $36,000, or 7.1%, to $469,000, compared to a gross profit of $505,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This decrease in gross profit resulted from an increase in cost of goods sold. This increase was primarily due to an increase in material and labor costs, driven mainly to higher sales volume, and increased compensation expense for new and current employees. The increase of cost of goods sold was offset by an increase of the revenues as described above. Recent Business Highlights: Gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, decreased by 16.7%, or $301,000, to $1,506,000, compared to a gross profit of $1,807,000 for the same period in 2023. This decrease in gross profit resulted from an increase in cost of goods sold. This increase was primarily due to an increase in material and labor costs, driven mainly to higher sales volume, and increased compensation expense for new and current employees. In addition, there was an increase of other cost of goods sold related to miscellaneous expenses. The increase of cost of goods sold was offset by an increase of the revenues as described above. Financial income, net for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $252,000, a decrease of $216,000 or 46.1% compared to $468,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to less interest income from investments in marketable securities and money market funds. Webb Campbell Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $9,836,000, an increase of $3,523,000, or 55.8% compared to $6,313,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in expenses related to salaries and share-based compensation as we continue to expand our US personnel and sales force in anticipation of FDA approval. In addition, there was an increase of expenses due to clinical, regulatory and development expenses related to our expected launch into the TCAR (transcarotid revascularization) market and CGuard Prime product preparation expenses for the anticipated U.S. commercial launch, offset by a reduction in clinical trial expenses associated with the C-GUARDIANS FDA Study as the one-year follow-up finalized in the second quarter of 2024. Engaged with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the CGuard Prime carotid stent system in the U.S. ahead of an anticipated first half 2025 approvalAnnounced approval of and enrolled first patients in the CGUARDIANS II pivotal study of the CGuard Prime carotid stent system for use during TCAR proceduresEstablished headquarters in Miami, Florida, to optimally support the anticipated U.S. commercial launch of CGuard Prime in the first half of 2025, if approvedAchieved quarterly revenue and unit records of $1.95M and 3.5K respectively in served markets Marvin Slosman, CEO of InspireMD, commented: \"2024 was a year of tremendous progress at InspireMD. We advanced CGuard Prime, our best-in-class carotid implant, toward potential U.S. approval by submitting our PMA application to the FDA. We also initiated the CGUARDIANS II pivotal study for its use in the large and growing TCAR market - an important step in expanding our development pipeline.\u201d InspireMD, Inc.

And he\u2019s facing another problem. \u201cCanadians are mad at us,\u2019\u2019 he said. China is widely seen as a source of the world steel industry\u2019s problems. Chinese overproduction, heavily subsidized by Beijing, has flooded the world with steel and kept prices low, hurting steelmakers in the United States and elsewhere.

This time, \u201cthere is no particular reason to think that the economics won\u2019t be more of the same: small gains for the U.S. steel and aluminum producers and employees, but larger overall losses for the rest of U..S manufacturing,\u2019\u2019 said Christine McDaniel, research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center.

The pain won\u2019t just be felt by foreign steel and aluminum plants. The tariffs will likely drive up costs for American companies that use the metals, such as automakers, construction firms and beverage makers that use cans. The threats to the economy have rattled stock markets. CEO Ron Khormaei says Steelport\u2019s Japanese and German competitors are benefiting. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper for them,\u2019\u2019 he said. Khormaei says his small company \u2014 it has 12 employees \u2014 will lose business if it raises prices. So he\u2019s doing everything he can to cut costs \u2014 keeping inventories tight, for example, and limiting travel to trade shows. Critics say Trump\u2019s metals tariffs are hitting the wrong target. Moreover, economists have found, the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \u201cdownstream\u2019\u2019 manufacturers that use steel and aluminum. In 2021, production at such companies dropped by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs, canceling out the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023. Trump\u2019s first-term steel and aluminum tariffs benefited American producers of the two metals, encouraging them to increase production. But the beneficiaries were relatively few: The U.S. steel industry, for instance, employs fewer than 150,000 people. Walmart alone has 1.6 million employees in the United States. The president insists that steel imports are a threat to the very existence of the United States. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have, as an example, steel, and lots of other things, we don\u2019t have a military and frankly we won\u2019t have \u2014 we just won\u2019t have a country very long,\u201d Trump said last week in his joint address to Congress.

The EU measures will cover U.S. imports worth around $28 billion (26 billion euros) and include not only steel and aluminum but textile, home appliances and farm products. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will also be hit, as they were during Trump\u2019s first term. Meanwhile, companies that use steel are already feeling the pain. Error! There was an error processing your request. In 2018, in an effort to protect American steelmakers from foreign competition, he imposed tariffs of 25% on foreign steel and 10% on aluminum, using a 1962 trade law to declare them a threat to U.S. national security. But Trump isn\u2019t just hitting steel and aluminum. He\u2019s slapped 20% tariffs on all Chinese imports. He\u2019s set to hammer all Canadian and Mexican products with 25% taxes next month, while limiting the tariff on Canadian energy to 10% \u2013 moves he has twice postponed with 30-day reprieves. And he has an ambitious and complicated plan to impose \u201creciprocal tariffs,\u2019\u2019 raising U.S. import taxes to match those of countries that impose higher levies on American products. The latest tariffs are an amped-up replay from Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cUnilateral tariffs will raise prices, cost American jobs, and strain alliances,\u201d Philip Luck and Evan Brown of the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a report last month. Canada plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on almost $21 billion (nearly Canadian $30 billion) of U.S. exports, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to speak before the announcement and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The tariffs landed most heavily on American allies: Canada is the No. 1 supplier of foreign steel and accounts for more than half of aluminum exports to the United States. Mexico, Japan and South Korea are also major steel exporters to the U.S. Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this story. Trump spared Canada and Mexico after they agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020. For some U.S. trading partners, the tariffs were supplanted by import quotas. And the first Trump administration also allowed American companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn\u2019t find the steel they needed from domestic U.S. producers.

WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is again lashing out at three of his biggest irritants: foreign steel, foreign aluminum and Canada. The Trump administration on Wednesday will effectively plaster 25% taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 on all steel and aluminum imports. The president said on Tuesday that the U.S. would double the forthcoming levy on the two metals to 50% if they come from Canada \u2014 but pulled back on the threat by the afternoon after the province of Ontario suspended its plans for retaliatory tariffs. The scope and unpredictability of Trump\u2019s tariff agenda threatens to rekindle inflation and to slow growth by discouraging companies from making investments until the trade tensions have eased. \u201cIf you\u2019re an executive in the board room, are you really going to tell your board it\u2019s the time to expand that assembly line?\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Khormaei said that one of his Canadian customers just cancelled an order by email: \u201cThank you. We love your product. We are not buying.\u2019\u2019 Trump was originally punching back at the government of Ontario for imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity sold to the United States, a move that was itself a response to Trump's tariff threats. After Trump said he'd hit the Canadians with a 50% metals tax, Ontario suspended its planned electricity surcharge. In response, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the U.S. would pull back on doubling the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. This time, Trump is closing those loopholes and raising the levy on aluminum to 25%. U.S. steelmakers can step up production to offset lost imports. They can also raise prices \u2013 and have already started, putting U.S. companies that use American steel at a disadvantage to competitors who get theirs elsewhere. Aluminum is a different story. The United States has just four aluminum smelters and only two of them were fully operating last year. Increasing U.S. smelter production would require \u201cenough power for a small city,\u201d S&P Global said in a report last week. His 2018 sanctions were gradually watered down. Steelport Knife Co. in Portland, Oregon, uses U.S. steel in its knives for home cooks and professional chefs. Last month, its American steel supplier, anticipating Trump\u2019s tariffs, raised its price by 10%. Taken by themselves, the metals tariffs are unlikely to do much damage to the nearly $30 trillion U.S. economy. \u201cSteel and aluminum \u2013 they\u2019re just a drop in the ocean,\u2019\u2019 said Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist at S&P Global Ratings. But the U.S. already uses trade barriers to keep out most Chinese steel. China accounted for less than 2% of U.S. steel imports last year, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. \u201cInstead of focusing on the real issue \u2014 China\u2019s market-distorting policies \u2014 the United States risks entangling itself in tariff disputes with its closest allies,\u2019\u2019 wrote Luck and Brown at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.", "https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-retailer-big-box-stocks-selloff-consumer-spending-strength-recession-2025-3": "Both are just the latest examples in a string of downbeat consumer signals. Last month, retail stocks were rocked by Walmart's underwhelming fiscal year outlook, suggesting a looming spending unwind. Even before this year's economic uncertainty caused recessionary fears to spike, consumers were already signaling lower spending intentions in the first quarter. Delta, Southwest, and Jet Blue each cited macroeconomic uncertainty as a leading reason for lowered earnings forecasts this week. A weaker outlook for travel demand has slashed first-quarter revenue expectations. Delta fell as much as 8.7% Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, disappointing earnings projections from Dick's pushed the athletic retailer's stock down almost 6% in Tuesday's session. While Americans' buying spree has been a source of economic and market strength since 2022, consumer endurance is petering out: stubborn inflation, high interest rates, and the threat of tariffs are pushing spenders into a cost-saving mentality. Jump to Month-to-month sales fell 0.22% in February, excluding automobiles and gasoline, according to the CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor. The notion of a spending pullback has ripped into the stock market over recent weeks, adding to economic pressures that have pushed the benchmark S&P 500 index to drop 9.4% from a February high. Losses, though, have been even heavier among big-box retailers that are seeing a similar slowdown in consumer spending. Kohl's sank 23% by around midday on Tuesday. For the full year, the retailer expects net sales to drop 5%-7%. Earnings per share are forecast between $0.10-$0.60, well below consensus estimates. Monday marked the index's most painful day this year \u2014 among notable losers were stocks exposed to consumer lending, such American Express, Capital One, and Discover. Disappointing outlooks from a range of companies show expectations for strong consumer spending have ebbed after years of US shoppers helping to prop up the post-pandemic economy. Airlines and retailers are the latest casualties of mounting calls for a weaker consumer as Wall Street positions for a possible economic slowdown. A growing number of firms are signaling a weaker outlook for US consumer spending, putting a key pillar of economic support in focus for investors this year.", "https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/futures-rise-after-wall-st-selloff-tariffs-inflation-data-focus-2025-03-12/": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://mises.org/mises-wire/spending-cuts-wont-weaken-us-economy-they-will-strengthen-it": "Bloating GDP with public spending and debt is not growing; it is the recipe for disaster. Government spending was out of control, leading money supply growth to soar, and the cumulative inflation suffered by Americans in the past four years is over 20.9 percent, with groceries and gas prices rising by more than 40 percent. Excessive government spending was not only the cause of the rise in money supply growth and the burst of inflation but also led to an $8.47 trillion increase in debt and an unsustainable path to financial ruin if policies remained the same. According to the Congressional Budget Office, with no policy changes, the United States would have accumulated deficits of $12.6 trillion between 2025 and 2030. Net interest outlays were expected to grow from $881 billion in 2024 to $1.2 trillion by 2030, even assuming no recessions or unemployment increases. Reprints, Permissions and Copyrights Private GDP should measure the economy, as government spending and debt do not drive productive growth. Stripping government spending can give us a more accurate picture of the reality of the productive sector in America. The latest Atlanta Fed estimates show a massive decline in net exports (-3.7 percent) due to a large increase in imports, a small decline in consumption of goods (-0.09 percent) but strong services (+0.62 percent) and rises in government expenditure (+0.34 percent) and a healthy increase in investment (+0.62 percent). Thus, the surprising factor is an abnormal slump in exports and a rise in imports that may be revised, because the trade deficit in December 2024 rose to a record $98.4 billion and GDP did not reflect such a massive slump in net exports. The concerning thing is that government spending continues to be excessive, and the United States is running an annualized $2.5 trillion deficit.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the first quarter saw a decrease of -1.6 percent in the annualized rate, followed by a 0.6 percent drop in the second quarter. Hundreds of analysts, commentators, and economists, along with the NBER, swiftly declared that this was not a recession. Thus, it is hilarious to read the hundreds of comments arguing that the Atlanta Fed NowCast means that the new administration\u2019s policies are causing a recession. Subscribe to the Mises Wire We must remember that 2024\u2019s 2.8 percent GDP growth reflected almost $2 trillion in borrowing, a roughly one-to-one spending-to-growth ratio and a dangerous path to a debt crisis. A research study from MIT Sloan published on July 17, 2024, by Mark Kritzman et al., titled \u201cThe Determinants of Inflation,\u201d concluded that federal spending was the overwhelming driver of the inflation spike in 2022, estimating it was two to three times more significant than any other factors. The\u00a0Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow\u00a0model projection for real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025 (Q1 2025) is now showing a slump to -1.5 percent. This marks a significant downward revision from the previous estimate of 2.3 percent on February 19, 2025. Cutting government spending is essential to reduce prices, bring inflation under control and stop the looming public finance disaster. By 2024, it became evident that revenue measures would not reduce the United States federal deficit. Deficits are always a spending problem. The views expressed on Mises Wire and mises.org are not necessarily those of the Mises Institute. Mises Wire offers contemporary news and opinion through the lens of Austrian economics and libertarian political economy. Such an enormous decline is strange. How did we go from +2.3 percent to -1.5 percent in less than a month? That kind of collapse in an economy as large as the United States is exceedingly rare. As I wrote a few months ago, the United States has been in a private sector recession for months. However, an abnormal increase in government spending during a period of growth and a risky borrowing policy led to a bloated Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The United States had a $7.59 trillion nominal GDP increase between 2021 and 2024 compared to a rise of $8.47 trillion in government debt. This marks the worst GDP growth adjusted for government debt accumulation since the 1930s. We must remember that US government spending financed by increasing federal debt accounted for about 22 percent to 25 percent of the total US GDP growth over 2021\u20132024. This extraordinary increase in government spending in the middle of a recovery led to record-high government debt and was the leading cause of money supply growth and, with it, the inflation burst that Americans are suffering today. The United States will not enter a recession due to the change of administration, but because of the excess spending policies of the Biden years. Reducing federal spending, deficit, and debt accumulation is essential to recover the health of the economy. The immediate reaction from the media is to call this the beginning of a \u201cTrump recession\u201d and blame it on President Trump\u2019s policies. Interestingly, on June 1, 2022, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow estimated the second quarter of 2022 growth at +1.3 percent. By July 1, 2022, it had dropped to -2.1 percent, a shift of 3.4 percentage points in 30 days. What did the media call it? \u201cGrowth scare\u201d. A similar thing happened in the third quarter of 2021. The estimate fell from 6.1 percent (July 30) to 2.3 percent (October 1), a 3.8-point drop over two months.

Many analysts are warning that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts will cause a recession if government spending is aggressively reduced. However, cutting spending may \u201creduce\u201d GDP but does not harm productive economic growth; it will likely strengthen it.

The company expects sales in local currencies to decline in the first half, with a softer first quarter and a sequential improvement in the second quarter. A more positive outlook for the second half is supported by a strong reception of newly launched products and partnerships in both divisions, along with additional launches in 2025. The expectations regarding profitability are based on an average exchange rate forecast for full year 2025 of one euro equaling CHF 0.95 and one US dollar equaling CHF 0.90. Adjusted net profit2 was CHF 103.1 million, down from CHF 164.4 million in 2023, when earnings were significantly boosted by a one-time positive effect related to transitional measures from the Swiss tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were CHF 8.08, compared to CHF 12.88 in 2023. Order entry in the Partnering Business for the full year decreased slightly more than sales as OEM customers adjusted their ordering patterns, shifting from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Despite this shift, the book-to-bill ratio remained close to 1. The Partnering Business generated sales of CHF 537.3 million in 2024 (2023: CHF 622.6 million or CHF 613.1 million in local currencies), marking a decrease of 13.7% in Swiss francs and 12.4% in local currencies. As anticipated, Tecan did not record any meaningful sales from the pass-through of material costs in this segment for 2024, compared to CHF 8.0 million in 2023. Tecan (www.tecan.com) improves people's lives and health by empowering customers to scale healthcare innovation globally from life science to the clinic. Tecan is a pioneer and global leader in laboratory automation. As an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Tecan is also a leader in developing and manufacturing OEM instruments, components and medical devices that are then distributed by partner companies. Founded in Switzerland in 1980, the company has 3,300 employees, with manufacturing, research and development sites in Europe, North America and Asia, and maintains a sales and service network in over 70 countries. In 2024, Tecan generated sales of CHF 934 million (USD 1,062 million; EUR 984 million). Registered shares of Tecan Group are traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange (TECN; ISIN CH0012100191). Cash flow from operating activities was CHF 148.5 million, compared to CHF 160.6 million in 2023. Cash conversion improved to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%). Thanks to solid cash flow management, Tecan's net liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term time deposits, less bank liabilities, loans, and the outstanding bond) increased to CHF 153.7 million as of December 31, 2024, up from CHF 112.6 million on December 31, 2023. [email\u00a0protected] In 2024, Tecan advanced its product portfolio with significant launches in genomics, proteomics, and cell biology. Examples include the Resolvex i300 module, introduced in February, which enhances throughput in proteomics by integrating with the Fluent\u00ae platform, and the Spark Cyto 3D, which supports drug discovery by enabling the analysis of complex 3D cell models. During a Capital Markets Day in October 2024, Tecan previewed Veya\u2122, a multi-omics liquid handling workstation that simplifies lab automation and boosts productivity. Officially launched at the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (SLAS) international conference in San Diego, USA, in January 2025, Veya provides effortless automation by overcoming key barriers in lab automation. 3 The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Life Sciences Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 6.4 million). The adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the Partnering Business segment excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 5.3 million). In the second half of 2024, the Life Sciences Business segment experienced moderate order entry growth in local currencies compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio slightly above 1 for the full year.

Market weakness in China also impacted the Cavro OEM components business and sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence\u2122 product line to larger global OEM customers with significant exposure to China. However, outside China, sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence product line developed positively, with increased contributions from newly launched systems. Sales in the Paramit product line, which served medical market customers, were negatively affected by normalized demand patterns following the replenishment of depleted inventories in 2023, when supply chain disruptions eased, and by the anticipated reduction in sales from the pure pass-through of material costs. These impacts were specific to a single customer and included a model transition, rather than being related to end market conditions. All these factors had a more pronounced impact in the second half of the year, when segment sales decreased by 15.9% in local currencies. Tecan Group Martin Br\u00e4ndle Attachment New launches and rich project pipeline in Partnering Business Life Sciences Business (end-customer business) In 2024, Tecan enhanced its operational resilience by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and continuing to optimize its global organizational footprint. Following the successful transfer of Cavro component production to facilities in Morgan Hill, California, and Penang, Malaysia, and the closure of the San Jose site in 2023, Tecan relocated its genomic reagents site from Redwood City to the expanding Morgan Hill hub at the end of 2024. In Penang, Tecan successfully passed an extensive FDA inspection, laying a strong foundation for future production of medical devices, including class 3 devices. The first medical device production was successfully transitioned to Penang in 2024. Alongside site consolidation, Tecan focused on supply chain optimization and increased vertical integration of manufacturing to leverage the Group's full capabilities and realize cost synergies. Based on the solid cash flows for the full year 2024 and on the basis of an ongoing positive business outlook, the Board of Directors will propose at the Company's Annual General Meeting on April 18, 2024, an unchanged dividend of CHF 3.00 per share. Half of the dividend, i.e., CHF 1.50, will again be paid out from the available capital contribution reserve and is therefore not subject to withholding tax. Adjusted EBITDA1 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) was CHF 164.4 million, down from CHF 220.6 million in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 17.6% of sales (2023: 20.5%), aligning with the revised margin outlook of 16-18%. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, as profitability is highly volume-dependent. However, profitability was supported by a comprehensive cost-reduction program. Additionally, exchange rate movements in major currencies against the Swiss franc negatively impacted the margin by approximately 40 basis points. Enhancing operational resilience through cost-reduction initiatives, while expanding global operations and commercial reach Financial results full-year and second half of 2024 About Tecan Sales in the Life Sciences Business in 2024 reached CHF 397.0 million (2023: CHF 451.8 million or CHF 442.1 million in local currencies), reflecting a decrease of 12.1% in Swiss francs and 10.2% in local currencies. Reduced CAPEX spending by the biopharmaceutical industry globally, along with government and academic customers in the US, resulted in decreased demand for life science research instruments. Additionally, market weakness in China negatively impacted demand, as the announced stimulus program failed to provide any impetus in 2024. Instead, it prompted some customers to delay orders while awaiting funding decisions. Contributing to a more favorable sales development in the Life Sciences Business were recovering consumables sales post-pandemic, a solid service business due to a higher installed base of instruments, and continued strong demand for newly launched products, particularly from genomic diagnostics companies. Recurring sales of services, consumables and reagents increased to 57.6% of segment sales (2023: 52.8%). The adjusted EBITDA3 for this segment was CHF 91.1 million, compared to CHF 125.6 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.9% of sales, compared to 20.1% in 2023. Sales of CHF\u00a0934.3 million (2023: CHF\u00a01,074.4 million), down by -13.0% in Swiss francs and by -11.5% in local currencies; H2 sales decrease by -11.3% in local currenciesDecline in sales mainly due to softness in the instrument business with biopharmaceutical companies globally and general market weakness in ChinaAdjusted EBITDA of CHF 164.4 million (2023: CHF 220.6 million), adjusted EBITDA margin reached 17.6% (2023: 20.5%)Margins declined due to lower sales volume, but were partly offset by cost-reduction measuresAdjusted net profit of CHF\u00a0103.1 million (2023: CHF\u00a0164.4 million), adjusted earnings per share of CHF\u00a08.08 (2023: CHF\u00a012.88)Proposal for a stable dividend of CHF 3.00 per share Operating cash flow of CHF 148.5 million (2023: CHF 160.6 million), cash conversion increased to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%) Tecan reports 2024 financial results, enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions In 2024, reduced spending in the biopharmaceutical industry led to decreased demand for life science research instruments, affecting both the Life Sciences Business and the Partnering Business. Additionally, a general market weakness in China impacted both direct sales and indirect business through global OEM customers. In the Partnering Business, sales were further influenced by specific customer-related factors, including normalized demand patterns following inventory replenishment by a key customer in 2023. As a result, reported sales for the Group in fiscal year 2024 decreased by 13.0% in Swiss francs, totaling CHF 934.3 million (2023: CHF 1,074.4 million). In local currencies, sales were 11.5% below the prior-year period, aligning with the revised sales outlook from October 2024, which anticipated a decline of 12-14%. Sales in the second half decreased by 12.3% in Swiss francs and by 11.3% in local currencies compared to the prior-year period. These sales results were previously communicated in a trading statement on January 8, 2025.

In preparation for the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Tecan has integrated related data management into its Finance function. For the first time, Tecan's financial auditors conducted a limited assurance audit of key 2024 environmental and social data points. Further progress was made towards greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, with renewable sources accounting for 87% of all electricity purchased. In 2025, Tecan will continue its pragmatic approach to managing risks and opportunities associated with the company's material topics.

The Partnering Business segment was impacted by a shift in OEM customer ordering patterns, moving from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Meanwhile, the Life Sciences Business segment saw moderate order entry growth in local currencies in the second half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, the Group's order entry in the second half decreased by 11.2% in local currencies. Participants should, if possible, dial in 15 minutes before the start of the event. The overall market environment is showing first signs of stabilization after a significant decline in demand last year, with further improvements expected over the course of 2025. However, new political uncertainties have emerged, including the announced reductions to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research budget in the US, which could further impact demand for life science research instruments. For 2025, Tecan anticipates that the year will begin with continued softer market conditions, with potential improvement as the year progresses. Depending on the extent of this improvement in the second half, the market could turn slightly positive for the full year, driven by specific growth segments, such as the clinical diagnostics market. The dial-in numbers for the conference call are as follows: M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland, March 12, 2025 - The Tecan Group (SIX Swiss Exchange: TECN) today announced its full set of audited financial results for 2024, underscoring its commitment to enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions. The company also initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025. Outlook Financial results for the full year 2024 - Highlights Reported EBIT in this segment (earnings before interest and taxes) reached CHF 39.5 million (2023: CHF 84.4 million). The reported operating profit margin decreased to 9.8% of sales (2023: 18.3%), primarily due to the negative volume effect, which resulted in missing economies of scale. Cost control measures helped alleviate the impact of lower sales volumes and adverse exchange rate effects. The adjusted EBITDA3 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) for this segment was CHF 79.1 million, compared to CHF 105.5 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.6% of sales, compared to 22.9% in 2023. At the 2024 Capital Markets Day, Tecan highlighted its strong Partnering Business relationships and robust project pipeline across its three business lines: Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit. Examples include Tecan's collaboration with Illumina in the Synergence line, supporting their expansion into multi-omics with the development of a new system. Through Paramit, Tecan assisted THINK\u00ae Surgical with the design transfer and initiated the manufacturing of their TMINI\u00ae miniature robotic system, cart, and smart cell charging station. Additionally, Paramit is manufacturing the Avive Connect AED, an innovative and user-friendly automated external defibrillator aimed at improving survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest. Key upcoming dates Reported EBIT amounted to CHF\u00a046.6 million (2023: CHF\u00a064.4 million), while the reported operating profit margin reached 8.7% of sales (2023: 10.3%). Similar to the Life Sciences Business segment, lower sales volumes and the resulting negative economies of scale were the main factors affecting margin development. The pipeline of new development projects has been further enriched through joint selling of Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit services, targeting key customers in the life sciences, lab diagnostics, and Medtech segments. Tecan aims to double new project signings by 2027 through joint selling efforts, a targeted approach, and strategic account management. In the second half of the year, sales declined by 5.0% in local currencies, following the sharp 15.5% decline in the first half. Sequentially, the Life Sciences Business segment grew by 13.6% in local currencies when comparing the second half of 2024 to the first half. Tecan also reiterated its mid-term outlook, in which the company anticipates returning to average organic growth rates in the mid to high single-digit percentage range in local currencies under normal market conditions, while continuously improving profitability. In 2024, Tecan demonstrated its commitment to agile cost management amid evolving economic conditions and revenue trends by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and optimizing its global organizational footprint. These efforts are designed to protect profitability without limiting the company's growth potential. As a result, Tecan forecasts an adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding restructuring, acquisition- and integration-related costs, of 17.5-18.5% of sales. Tecan will hold an analyst and media conference to discuss the 2024 annual results today at 09:00 (CET). The presentation will also be relayed by live audio webcast, which interested parties can access at www.tecan.com under Investor Relations. A link to the webcast will be provided immediately prior to the event. 2 The calculation of 2024 adjusted net profit and adjusted earnings per share excludes restructuring costs as well as acquisition- and integration-related costs (+CHF 16.4 million) and accumulated amortization of acquired intangible assets (+CHF 19.0 million) and they were calculated with the reported Group tax rate of 13.6%.

This new entity includes team members with over 20 years of experience working with Tecan, bringing valuable local market knowledge to better serve this growing market. Further building on sustainability activities Tecan CEO Dr. Achim von Leoprechting commented: \"Tecan is navigating a challenging market environment marked by reduced spending in our target markets, leading to lower demand in both the Life Sciences and Partnering Business segments. These challenges have been compounded by general market weakness in China and specific customer-related factors. In response, we have implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program and optimized our global operations to reinforce our leading position. The long-term trends in healthcare remain unchanged: from life science research to clinical applications, automation and innovation are crucial for scaling healthcare solutions in research, clinical diagnostics, and medtech.

(File photo: AP/Louise Delmotte) The world\u2019s second-biggest economy also set a growth target of 5 per cent for a third consecutive time, among others. In particular, Chinese tech stocks may present an \u201cattractive risk-reward proposition and buy-on-weakness opportunity\u201d on the back of China\u2019s advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, upward earnings revisions and relatively inexpensive valuations, said Mr Yeap. SINGAPORE: Concerns over US tariffs have triggered volatility on Wall Street, but this does\u00a0not mean that Asia\u2019s stock markets will be in for a similarly rough ride, analysts said. Uncertainty surrounding US tariffs and potential retaliatory measures will continue to weigh on Asia's stock markets until more clarity emerges, analysts say. \u201cWhat started with a decline in expensive tech stocks \u2026 has given way to a broad-based equity sell-off as the looming threat of extended trade wars and softer economic data stoked fears of recession,\u201d said Mr Tim Murray, a capital markets specialist at T Rowe Price. Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Mr Zane Aw, research analyst at Phillip Securities Research, said the latest sell-off could potentially be the \u201cend of the bull run\u201d on Wall Street given factors such as expensive valuations and recent sluggish economic data. For Singapore, Mr Aw noted that opportunities lie in certain sectors that are \u201cbetter sheltered from a trade war\u201d, such as construction, utilities and telecommunications. Business The \u201cback and forth over tariffs is already having an initial negative economic impact\u201d, but this is not yet reflected in corporate profits, which are expected to grow 13 per cent this year, said the bank\u2019s chief investment officer Felix Brill. US markets saw another session of losses on Tuesday (Mar 11) amid more trade uncertainties, as the president halted a plan to double US tariffs on Canadian steel and metal imports to 50 per cent just hours after first threatening them. Upgraded but still having issues? Contact us While Asian stocks typically track market movements in the United States, their declines \u201cmay be more contained\u201d, given that markets in this part of the world have not rallied as much as the US and have a smaller presence of high-growth stocks, said IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong. Wall Street started the week with a\u00a0rout that wiped out US$4 trillion in market value from the S&P 500.\u00a0The Nasdaq Composite saw its steepest one-day decline since 2022, hit hard by technology-related stocks struggling with high valuations. Citing Chinese and Hong Kong stocks as examples, he noted that Chinese policymakers have pledged robust fiscal stimulus and a commitment to boost domestic consumption at the recent Two Sessions meeting. \u201cTrade uncertainty is the main driver of market concerns but once we get more clarity, consumers and businesses may adjust, and the impact could be less severe than feared,\u201d said Mr Yeap. Mr Yeap is more optimistic, noting that if global trade tensions were to escalate, the banks may continue to benefit from wealth inflows, given the country\u2019s status as a safe haven. We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be. Even then, analysts like Mr Aw reckoned that Asian stocks are still \u201clikely to fare better than their US counterpart\u201d. This audio is generated by an AI tool. But the trio of local banks - DBS, OCBC and UOB - which have been investors\u2019 favourites, may no longer be as attractive given the high valuations that may limit upside potential. \u201cAlso, as the banks are cyclical stocks that are highly correlated with the overall economic outlook, a deterioration in US economic conditions resulting in more than expected number of rate cuts would affect their share price performance from margin compression,\u201d the analyst added. On the other hand, VP Bank continues to be overweight on US stocks even as it sees unpredictable trade policies stoking further volatility ahead.

In addition, the expectation that Trump may be sensitive to declines in the stock market, known as the \u201cTrump put\u201d, is \u201cso far nowhere to be seen\u201d, he added.

Kostin noted a catalyst that improves the economic growth outlook, either evidenced by stronger economic data or a reduced tariff policy plan that could spur an upturn in stocks. On Wednesday, perhaps the first sign of better economic data emerged as a softer-than-expected inflation reading sent the major stock indexes higher at the market open. \"We lower our 2025 year-end S&P 500 index target to 6200 (from 6500) to reflect a 4% reduction in our modeled fair-value forward P/E multiple (20.6x from 21.5x),\" Kostin and his team wrote. Goldman's own economics team recently revised down its 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from a prior projection of 2.2% as impacts from tariffs and political uncertainty have weighed on the outlook. Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance \"Our new index target suggests an 11% price gain during the balance of the year, similar to our return estimate at the start of the year but from a lower starting point.\" A nearly 10% fall in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has prompted Wall Street strategists to revaluate their bullish views headed into 2025. Earlier this week, the S&P 500 nearly entered correction territory \u2014 defined as a 10% drop from its most recent high \u2014 as fears about the health of the US economy and uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policy shook investor confidence. Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer. AOL Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Kostin flagged the GDP downgrade in his note on Tuesday, saying this slower growth forecast prompted a downward revision in its estimate for S&P 500 earnings growth this year to 7% from 9%. Advertisement And while Kostin may be the first strategist to outright lower their year-end target for the S&P, Kostin isn't the only strategist who has recently warned that the path forward for US stocks likely looks different than last year's forecasts. \"The risks of a drawdown of more than 10% have admittedly grown, however. If that occurs, we see a 'growth scare' of a 14-20% decline from peak as most likely, which could shift us into our bear case.\" \"Weaker economic activity usually means weaker corporate earnings growth.\" For premium support please call: \"We have seen the US equity market on a rocky path higher through year-end, and have believed that our 6,600 can absorb a 5-10% drawdown,\" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. \"Our revised estimates reflect the recently reduced GDP growth forecast of our US Economics team, a higher assumed tariff rate, and higher level of uncertainty that is typically associated with a greater equity risk premium,\" Kostin wrote.", "https://www.goodreturns.in/news/morgan-stanley-expects-sensex-to-hit-1-05-000-by-dec-2025-despite-market-decline-1411389.html": "Cloudflare Ray ID: 91f4d0e4dff48236\u2022Your IP:Click to reveal54.161.24.7\u2022Performance & security by Cloudflare You can email the site owner to let them know you were blocked.

According to the USCIS, visitors who are already registered include: The new requirements will take effect on Friday, April 11, according to the DHS document published in the Federal Register Wednesday. Failure or refusal to register or be fingerprinted, or failure to keep proof of registration on their person at all times, is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to six months, or both. The exceptions: American Indians born in Canada who entered the United States under section 289 of the INA, and members of the Texas Band of Kickapoo Indians who entered the United States under the Texas Band of Kickapoo Act are not required to register. Visitors 18 and over must keep proof of their registration with them at all times, the USCIS said. The USCIS will be creating a process for visitors to register and suggests that anyone who will need to register create a\u00a0USCIS online account to be ready for it. You can find details on how to do that here. The new requirements take effect on Friday, April 11, 2025, 30 days after the new requirements were published in the Federal Register. Starting in April, all of them staying in the U.S. for 30 days or longer will need to be registered with the U.S. government, along with all other foreign nationals, and all of them over the age of 14 will need to be fingerprinted, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. There is no fee to register, although the DHS did float the idea of charging $30 per registrant and welcomed comment on the option. \u201cThis policy is associated with some of the most shameful stains on our country\u2019s history, including the reactionary and xenophobic internment of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent in concentration camps across the United States during WWII, as well as racist and xenophobic profiling in the wake of September 11th,\u201d Jayapal said in a release. \u201cNow, the Trump administration is aiming to use this policy as a tool to force immigrants to register and subject themselves to a mass deportation scheme.\u201d Traditionally, Canadians who flew into the country had to register, but anyone driving over the northern border into the U.S. was not required to as Canada has had a friendly status with the United States. Getting lumped in with foreign nationals who commit \"vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans,\" as the EO states, may not sit well with our Northern neighbors who are already upset about the constant threats of tariffs and Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state. Many Canadians have boycotted U.S. products and announced plans to vacation somewhere else. But on President Donald Trump's first day in office, he issued an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to\u00a0ensure that \"aliens\" comply with their duty to register and treat violations \"as a civil and criminal enforcement priority\" as part of the new administration's sweeping crackdown on immigration. U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a ranking member of the Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee, announced Wednesday plans to introduce the No Round Up Act to repeal the immigration law that allows this move.

But after campaigning on lowering prices on day one, in recent weeks \u2014 including during his address to Congress last week \u2014 he has warned the country to get ready for a \"little disturbance\" from potential trade wars. A country's GDP is the total market value of all the goods and services produced and rendered in a specific time period, and is often an indicator of the country's economic performance. Countries that have had tariffs imposed on them also may choose to retaliate with tariffs on American goods and services, further harming American businesses. When a reporter on Air Force One asked Trump Monday evening if he was worried about a recession, the president said, \"Who knows? A recession is a downward trend in the business cycle characterized by a decline in production, sales and employment. Recessions are common and can be very quick or last months or years. The U.S. saw drops after the collapse of the housing market in 2008 and during the first months of the pandemic shutdown in 2020, and the country recovered. But sometimes they spiral out of control and lead to a depression. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a recession in the U.S. is \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\u201d The nonprofit bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official designator of business cycles. Trump has repeatedly stated that the other countries would pay for the tariffs, although economists describe them as taxes on foreign imports that drive up prices at the register since affected companies pass any additional costs to the consumer. To be a recession, the economic situation has to hit three criteria \u2014 depth, diffusion, and duration \u2014 but extreme conditions in one can offset weaker conditions in another. The committee looks at: \"I hate to predict things like that,\" he told Fox host Maria Bartiromo. \"There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big.\" The hardest part of a recession is uncertainty about your financial situation, now and in the future. Investopedia.com suggests the following tips to get through a recession: If the trend continues, a recession is possible. An unofficial definition of a recession many experts use as a rule of thumb is when the gross national product (GDP) drops two financial quarters in a row. \u201cAll I know is this: We\u2019re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we\u2019re going to become so rich, you\u2019re not going to know where to spend all that money. I\u2019m telling you, you just watch. We\u2019re going to have jobs. We\u2019re going to have open factories. It\u2019s going to be great.\u201d Last week, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u00a0posted preliminary economic data\u00a0showing a drop of 2.4 percent for the GDP in the first quarter of 2025, the first time we've seen a quarterly drop since 2022 during the pandemic. But those indicators can get into the weeds and become very technical. A depression is far worse. A depression is a widespread, extreme recession that lasts longer and causes generational damage to the economy. The last one in the U.S., the Great Depression of the 1930s, saw the stock market crash, banks failing, and thousands of Americans out of work for over a decade. (This story was updated with new information.) \u201cFor consumers, tariffs are like another form of inflation, just spelled differently,\u201d said Darpan Seth, CEO of Nextuple, which helps build and support programs to help its clients get products for consumers in stores or online. \u201cThey have the same effect of rising prices.\u201d In just over one month in office, the Trump administration has fired great swaths of federal workers around the country, cut billions in funding to U.S. aid programs and scientific research programs, and threatened unpredictable on-again-off-again tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China that will raise prices for Americans, especially on groceries. The slide continued Tuesday after Trump escalated his trade war with Canada by pledging to double his planned steel and aluminum tariffs after the province of Ontario\u00a0said it would charge\u00a0U.S. customers more for electricity in retaliation for Trump's previous tariff threats. The definition is a little fuzzy, and recessions are often not declared until they've already been going on for some time. Indications of a recession often include: \u201cThere isn\u2019t necessarily a reason to be extremely concerned about an imminent recession, because we\u2019re coming out of two very strong years of growth,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY Parthenon, told CNN Monday, \u201can environment where income growth was strong, where productivity growth was strong, where consumer spending growth is strong and, really, where the economy overall was quite strong.\u201d But uncertainty about what tariffs will do is causing the stock market to be more volatile than usual, which also affects anyone with a 401(k) retirement plan. Are we heading for a recession? While Trump and his advisers have been steadfast in promising it will all lead to a stronger economy, these moves can have devastating effects on the economy, along with consumer and investor confidence. That could mean it will be a great time to buy a house, but it may also come at a time of income instability to keep paying for it. What does that mean? There is also concern Social Security is on the chopping block, with the world's richest man and presidential adviser Elon Musk calling it a \"Ponzi scheme\" and Trump claiming unsubstantiated \"shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud.\" With rumored cuts coming to Medicare and Medicaid, Americans may start keeping the money they have left to themselves. On Monday, U.S. stocks plunged. The Dow dropped 890 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq and broad S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day drop in over two years, largely in response to President Donald Trump's interview released the day before on Fox's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" when he wouldn't say whether the United States might face a recession this year. Trump has dismissed concerns over the stock market tumble of the last week. That doesn't necessarily mean we're moving into a recession. There are other reasons the GDP might slip in an otherwise strong economy, such as earlier this year when consumers and companies were bringing in imports at a higher rate in anticipation of higher prices from Trump's threats of tariffs. The Federal Reserve isn't lowering interest rates yet, but economists believe there will be multiple reductions in June, July and October due to a slowed economy from Trump's trade, fiscal, immigration and regulatory policies.", "https://www.wsbtv.com/news/wall-street-scrapes/JHAZVDJOZ5CQ5AZDOSS6NR5CPY/": " For his part, Trump said earlier on social media, \u201cThe only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.\u201d Oracle dropped 3.1% after the technology giant reported profit and revenue for the latest quarter that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations. ___ Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Stocks rose 0.4% in Shanghai and were nearly unchanged in Hong Kong as China's annual national congress wrapped up its annual session with some measures to help boost the slowing economy. Such tariffs can hurt the economy directly by raising prices for U.S. consumers and gumming up global trade. But even if they end up being milder than feared, all the whipsaw moves could create so much uncertainty that U.S. companies and consumers freeze, which would sap energy from the economy. In the bond market, Treasury yields clawed back some of their tumbles in recent months. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28% from 4.22% late Monday. In January, it was nearing 4.80%, before it began sinking on worries about the U.S. economy. Its stock nevertheless rallied 8.3% after the airline said it would soon begin charging some passengers to check bags, among other announcements. Other indexes likewise swung sharply through the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 478 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite ended up slipping 0.2%. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, but only after careening between a modest gain and a tumble of 1.5%. The main measure of Wall Street's health finished 9.3% below its all-time high after flirting with the 10% threshold that professional investors call a \u201ccorrection.\" Tuesday's swings followed more warning signals flashing about the economy as Trump's on -and- off -again rollout of tariffs creates confusion and pessimism for U.S. households and businesses. \u00a9 2025 Cox Media Group.

Helping to keep the market in check were several Big Tech stocks, which steadied a bit after getting walloped in recent months. Elon Musk's Tesla rose 3.8%, for example, after Trump said he would buy a Tesla in a show of support for \"Elon's 'baby.'\" Other Big Tech superstars, which had led the market to record after record in recent years, also held a bit firmer. Nvidia added 1.7% to trim its loss for the year so far to 19%. It's struggled as the market's sell-off has particularly hit stocks seen as getting too expensive in Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. A report released Tuesday morning showed U.S. employers were advertising 7.7 million job openings at the end of January, just as economists expected. It's the latest signal that the U.S. job market remains relatively solid overall, for now at least, after the economy closed last year running at a healthy pace. Such head-spinning moves are becoming routine in what's been a scary ride for investors as Trump tries to remake the country and world through tariffs and other policies. Stocks have been heaving mostly lower on uncertainty about how much pain Trump is willing for the economy to endure in order to get what he wants. And moves by Trump and comments by his White House on Tuesday didn\u2019t clarify much. Stocks began tumbling in the morning after Trump said he would double planned tariff increases on steel and aluminum coming from Canada. The president said it was a response to moves a Canadian province made  after Trump began threatening tariffs on one of the United States' most important trading partners. Southwest Airlines also cut its forecast for an important underlying revenue trend, and it pointed specifically to less government travel, among other reasons, including wildfires in California and \u201csoftness in bookings and demand trends as the macro environment has weakened.\u201d In stock markets abroad, which have mostly been beating the United States so far this year, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. After that brief perk higher, though, stocks would go on to slide again into the end of trading. NEW YORK \u2014 (AP) \u2014 The U.S. stock market fell further Tuesday following President Donald Trump's latest escalation in his trade war, briefly pulling Wall Street 10% below its record set last month. And like it's been for most of the past few weeks, the market's slide on Tuesday was erratic and dizzying. Stocks pared their losses later in the day, even briefly eliminating them altogether, after Ontario\u2019s premier said he had agreed to remove the surcharge on electricity that had enraged Trump so much. Trump would afterward say that he would \u201cprobably\u201d return the steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada to 25%. Because Nvidia, Tesla and other Big Tech stocks have grown so massive in size, their movements carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than any other company. WSB Now Delta Air Lines' stock lost 7.3% after it said it's already seeing a change in confidence among customers, which is affecting demand for close-in bookings for its flights. That pushed the airline to roughly halve its forecast for revenue growth in the first three months of 2025, down to a range of 3% to 4% from a range of 7% to 9%. Trump has acknowledged the economy could feel some \u201cdisturbance\u201d because of the tariffs he's pushing. Asked on Tuesday just how much pain Trump would be willing for the economy and stock market to take, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to give an exact answer. But she said earlier in the press briefing that \u201cthe president will look out for Wall Street and for Main Street.\u201d Tesla's sales and brand have been under pressure as Musk has led efforts in Washington to cut spending by the federal government. Tesla's stock is down 42.9% for the young year so far. All told, the S&P 500 fell 42.49 points to 5,572.07.

Marketing isn\u2019t just about selling, it\u2019s about survival. In a world where customers have infinite choices, a brand that fails to evolve will fade into irrelevance, becoming a case study rather than a competitor. Walgreens\u2019 story is far from over, but whether it regains its footing depends on whether it learns the lessons it should have years ago. Walgreens had access to millions of prescriptions, purchase histories, and behavioral insights, but failed to use them effectively. Investing in digital and data-driven marketing to create personalized, habit-forming loyalty would reconnect Walgreens with customers who have drifted away to more digitally savvy competitors. Walgreens possessed all the essential elements for market dominance: unparalleled brand recognition that resonated across generations, a strategic network of locations within five miles of 78% of the American population and a consistent flow of in-store customer traffic that most retailers could only dream of. Yet somehow, these formidable competitive advantages gradually eroded, transforming from powerful market differentiators into missed opportunities as the company failed to capitalize on its unique position in the retail landscape. A retail brand is only as strong as its stores. Walgreens\u2019 stores became a liability rather than an asset. Customers noticed the decline in-store experience, dimly lit aisles, cluttered layouts, long checkout lines, and underwhelming product selections. Meanwhile, staffing cuts led to worse customer service, making it harder for customers to get prescriptions filled quickly and accurately. The brand identity prescription \u00a9 Carnyx Group Ltd 2025 | The Drum is a Registered Trademark and property of Carnyx Group Limited. All rights reserved. Walgreens, however, took a scattershot approach to promotions, relying on generic discounting rather than building loyalty through personalized engagement. Its loyalty program lacked the sophistication of CVS\u2019s ExtraCare or Amazon Prime, both of which use data-driven marketing to create personalized offers and incentives. For decades, Walgreens\u2019 brand revolved around convenience. But convenience changed, and Walgreens didn\u2019t. When Amazon made e-commerce seamless and CVS positioned itself as a \u201chealth-first\u201d destination, Walgreens remained stuck in the middle, neither the cheapest, nor the most innovative, nor the most customer-centric. In-store rehabilitation Fixing pricing perception to compete better with value-focused rivals is essential in an era where consumers can instantly compare prices online. The result? Walgreens trained customers to see it as an expensive option, where promotions were unreliable and loyalty went unrewarded. Every retailer must define what makes them indispensable: is it value, experience, exclusivity, or something else? Walgreens should have leaned into affordability and trust, a \u201cpeople-first pharmacy\u201d focused on accessible, community-driven healthcare. For retailers and marketers, Walgreens\u2019 decline offers a stark reminder: a strong brand must evolve with its customers, not expect customers to stay loyal out of habit. Data: the preventative medicine for brand decline Compare this to Target, which has doubled down on store experience with remodeled layouts, specialized in-store clinics, and curated product selections. Or look at Ulta, which has successfully merged beauty retail with a personalized customer experience through digital engagement and well-trained staff. The story of Walgreens\u2019 decline is a business case study in leadership missteps, shifting consumer behaviors and competitive pressures. But at its core, Walgreens\u2019 fall is a marketing failure. It lost its relevance, let its stores become unappealing, struggled to engage customers and failed to modernize its brand for a digital-first world. Digital transformation wasn\u2019t optional, it was essential. And Walgreens missed the moment. The digital experience shouldn\u2019t compete with the physical one; it should complement and enhance it, creating a seamless customer journey that builds brand loyalty regardless of touchpoint. Just as a doctor wouldn\u2019t treat symptoms without addressing the underlying disease, retailers can't solve deep-seated brand problems with superficial marketing fixes. Walgreens\u2019 journey from retail powerhouse to private equity rescue case shows that even the strongest brands need constant care and evolution, a prescription that every retailer should fill before it\u2019s too late. CVS aggressively expanded into digital health services, building an online pharmacy experience that integrated seamlessly with insurance providers, offering easy prescription refills and telehealth visits. Amazon, meanwhile, entered the space with PillPack, revolutionizing prescription management for the digital age. Walgreens, by contrast, built a fragmented online presence that never quite delivered on ease or integration. While competitors were turning their apps into full-service health platforms, Walgreens lagged. Imagine if Walgreens used AI to create personalized healthcare recommendations, subscription-based medication plans, and targeted product promotions. Data-driven loyalty programs (think Amazon Prime or Starbucks Rewards) could have transformed Walgreens from a place people occasionally shopped to a habit. Walgreens should have reimagined its stores to be modern, accessible, and digitally integrated. Express prescription pickup kiosks could have reduced wait times. More prominent healthcare partnerships in-store would have reinforced their wellness credentials. Community-driven health initiatives might have made each location a genuine neighborhood health hub rather than just another chain store. Listen to article4 min So, what can other retailers, particularly those in brick-and-mortar, learn from Walgreens\u2019 mistakes? For retailers and marketers alike, Walgreens is a cautionary tale, but also a playbook on how brands must evolve to survive. The physical store should be an extension of the brand identity, not an afterthought. There\u2019s a path back, but it won\u2019t come from financial restructuring alone. Walgreens\u2019 best hope for a turnaround lies in marketing: Walgreens wavered between convenience store and healthcare hub. A brand without a clear identity struggles to attract and retain customers. Walgreens, once valued at $100bn, has been acquired by private equity for $10bn / Adobe Stock Modernizing its stores to make them welcoming, efficient, and engaging means investing in both aesthetics and functionality, turning each location into a destination rather than a necessity. The consequence? Walgreens\u2019 customers moved their purchases online, and instead of buying from Walgreens.com, they bought from Amazon, Walmart, and CVS. Digital therapy: integrating online and offline experiences Great marketing doesn\u2019t just sell products, it reinforces a brand\u2019s purpose and creates meaningful connections with customers. A brand is not just its products, stores, or financial performance. A brand is a relationship with its customers, one built on perception, trust, and relevance. Advertisement CVS made a bold move to stop selling cigarettes in 2014, reinforcing its identity as a healthcare brand. Walgreens hesitated, keeping tobacco on its shelves even as its competitors signaled a shift toward wellness. The mixed messaging diluted Walgreens\u2019 identity. Was it a healthcare leader? A convenience retailer? A discount pharmacy? Customers weren\u2019t sure, and when customers are unsure, they leave. Marketing can change the world. Rebuilding trust in its brand by defining its core value to customers requires more than just a new slogan, it demands a fundamental rethinking of what Walgreens stands for in a crowded marketplace. For Walgreens, stores should have been a differentiator. Instead, they became a reason for customers to look elsewhere. Retailers that thrive use omnichannel marketing, where digital drives traffic to stores and stores enhance digital engagement. Walgreens needed a stronger mobile app integrating prescription refills, telehealth, and personalized promotions like CVS or Walmart Health. Walgreens was once a retail powerhouse. At its peak in 2015, the company\u2019s market capitalization was approximately $100bn. However, as of March 2025, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) agreed to be taken private by Sycamore Partners in a deal valued at approximately $10bn, marking a significant decline over the past decade.", "https://crooksandliars.com/2025/03/fox-news-host-yawns-us-economy-collapses": "Fox News host Harris Faulkner was one of the worst critics of President Joe Biden during COVID, after supply chain issues caused inflation.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. Note: All information on this page is subject to change.

The report continues that while many Trump measures have contributed to spooking the market into heavy de-risking, the President has delivered his crypto promises by establishing a crypto working group and launching a US BTC reserve last week. This justifies BTC\u2019s relative outperformance compared to equity indices since the election. \u201cEven a dovish surprise like a rate cut may fail to ignite a sustained rally, given potential market skepticism and overriding macro uncertainties.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin\u2019s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

'Donald's tariff plan harkens back to the era in the United States in the late 18th and the 19th centuries when the government was very small and tariffs were a way to build up the economic muscle of domestic manufacturers,' Johnston said of Trump's economic policy.

Follow him on Bluesky and X: @rickjnewman. Now that Donald Trump\u2019s second presidential term has gotten off to a rocky start, there\u2019s mounting suspicion that if a recession develops soon, Trump won\u2019t hesitate to blame it on Biden. There\u2019s a more radical corollary: Trump might not even mind tipping the economy into recession early in his term while it\u2019s easier to argue that it\u2019s Biden\u2019s fault. Bessent\u2019s marmish admonition is prompting comparisons with Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover\u2019s Treasury Secretary at the beginning of the Great Depression, who advocated severe austerity, no matter how painful, to \u201cpurge the rottenness out of the system.\u201d The Wall Street Journal ran a March 12 analysis suggesting that Trump is taking a similar \u201cliquidationist\u201d approach to the economy by soliciting market failures instead of intervening to stop them. Trump and his allies have already started blaming Biden for economic setbacks occurring on Trump\u2019s watch. While trying to explain a brutal 20-day stock market sell-off on March 11, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \u201cWe are in a period of transition from the mess that was created under Joe Biden. In the previous administration. Joe Biden left this country in an economic disaster.\u201d Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet Instead, Trump has rolled out tariffs more aggressively than almost anybody expected while showing no concern about unnerving sell-offs in the stock market. Forecasters are now lowering their growth estimates for 2025, raising their inflation estimates, and wondering what in the world Trump is trying to do. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said recently that the US economy needs a \u201cdetox period,\u201d a concept most economists find perplexing, given that Trump inherited a relatively healthy economy. Bessent says the economy needs more private spending and less reliance on government stimulus, which is generally true. But Congress could fix that gradually through less deficit spending and more prudent budgeting. \u201cDetox\u201d implies uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms that aren\u2019t even necessary, given that there\u2019s no crisis at the moment. Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Unless, that is, part of Trump\u2019s plan is to deliberately stress the economy during his first year in office. Many investors originally thought Trump would threaten severe tariffs but impose far less stringent measures. That storyline has now lapsed. Trump has aggressively ratcheted up his tariffs, and instead of easing up to give stocks a breather \u2014 the typical pattern during his first trade war in 2018 \u2014 he has basically looked the other way. \u201cYou can\u2019t really watch the stock market,\u201d Trump said on March 10. \u201cThe red flags of recession are furiously waving,\u201d Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a March 11 analysis. \u201cThe current slash and burn policy by the Trump Administration makes little economic sense.\u201d Joe Biden finished his one presidential term without a recession. Team Tariff may be signaling that, unlike Trump\u2019s first trade war in 2018 and 2019, they\u2019re not going to let up on tariffs just because markets squeal. The economic \u201ctransition\u201d Trump now envisions seems to be far more sweeping than the limited tariffs that marginally raised prices during his first term. If that\u2019s what he plans, then a painful period of supply chain disruptions, higher prices, lower profits, and possibly layoffs may be necessary to achieve whatever the long-term gain might be. It\u2019s hard to imagine any normal president trying to deliberately weaken the economy. Recessions are highly unpredictable and even when they\u2019re officially over, high unemployment and depressed living standards can linger for months or years, bringing down any politician they\u2019re associated with. A \u201cBidencession\u201d narrative is also taking root in Trump-friendly media. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if Joe Biden\u2019s recession shows up,\u201d a Fox News host said on March 7. To reiterate, there were virtually no signs of a looming recession when Biden left office on Jan. 20. In fact, a \u201csoft landing\u201d seemed to be underway in which the Fed wrangled inflation to tolerable levels without choking off spending so much that it caused a recession. The grace period for a new president being able to credibly blame fresh problems on his predecessor is obviously limited, and the sitting president eventually gets all the blame or credit for what happens in the economy. So if Trump truly wants to cause a recession, maybe he should hurry? Or did he? AOL Odder still are some of the messages Trump and his economic advisers are sending. During his speech to Congress on March 4, Trump said his tariffs would cause \u201ca little disturbance, but we\u2019re OK with that.\u201d That sounded like a different person than the first-term President Trump, who bragged repeatedly about the economy, whether warranted or not. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter. \u201cWe have talked recently with Washington insiders who think Trump wouldn't mind a recession this year,\u201d Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist for AGF Investments, said in his March 10 newsletter. \u201cThe Democrats \u2014 desperate for an issue \u2014 may have one.\u201d Advertisement Then during a March 9 Fox News interview, Trump dodged the question when asked if he was expecting a recession this year. \u201cThere is a period of transition,\u201d he said, elliptically. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is very big. It takes time.\u201d Markets bombed the following day, interpreting Trump\u2019s disregard of recession risks as an ominous sign. For premium support please call: Economists don\u2019t see a lot of long-term gain, but they\u2019re already measuring the short-term pain. Some economists have raised their odds of a recession since Trump took office to the range of 30% to 40%. Many others, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have cut their growth forecasts but stopped short of predicting a recession. Click here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices. Yet investors are stunned by the damage Trump has done to the economy in just two months. When Trump took office on Jan. 20, GDP growth was a solid 2.5%, the unemployment rate was a low 4.1%, and stocks were on a nice post-election run-up. Investors expected a \u201cTrump bump\u201d to keep the good times rolling, maybe even enliven the party.", "https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdcad": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is having difficulty keeping his government on an even keel.

Taking place from March 10-14, CERAWeek is convening the energy industry\u2019s foremost thought leaders to advance new ideas, insight and solutions to the biggest challenges facing the future of energy, the environment, and climate. Speaking at CERAWeek in Houston, Texas, Dr. Al Jaber called for durable, stable policies to meet the growing demand for energy. \u201cThe world is finally waking up to the fact that energy is the solution. Energy is the beating heart of economies, a key driver of prosperity and is fundamental to every aspect of human development. If we want a pro-growth world, we need pragmatic actions and policies that are pro-growth, pro-investment, pro-energy and pro-people.\u201d Dr. Al Jaber said that every energy option was needed and an \u2018and-and\u2019 approach that embraces diverse energy options was required to meet the rapid growth in worldwide demand. \u201cWe know that by 2035, there will be almost 9 billion people on this planet. In line with this growth, oil demand will increase from 103 to at least 109 million barrels per day. LNG and chemicals will expand by over 40% and total electricity demand will surge from 9,000GW to 15,000GW, which is a staggering 70% increase. We will need more LNG, more low-carbon oil, more nuclear and more commercially-viable renewables to meet all this demand.\u201d For media inquiries, please contact: media@adnoc.ae Dr. Al Jaber noted that those with easy access to energy supply and infrastructure will have a clear advantage over those who don\u2019t. \u201cThis is where we see huge opportunities for the UAE to further invest and deepen partnerships with the US across multiple sectors, including the energy-AI nexus.

Noting how the UAE injected energy realism into the climate process as host of COP28, Dr. Al Jaber said that the UAE Consensus delivered the most realistic breakthrough in years. \u201cThe UAE Consensus succeeded because it brought everyone to the table, and it resulted in a practical approach that followed market realities more than unrealistic mandates. The agreement cemented the reality that sustainable progress is simply not possible without access to reliable, affordable and secure energy.\u201d Dr. Al Jaber explained how the UAE\u2019s leadership has pursued a pragmatic \u2018and-and\u2019 approach, extending its energy leadership in oil and gas to renewables, nuclear, chemicals and low-carbon energies. \u201cThe UAE has built on 7 decades of experience in oil and gas to produce the world\u2019s least carbon-intensive barrels.

Tudor Investment Corp READ ALSO: 12 Best Multibagger Penny Stocks to Buy Now A trader cheers his market gains. Photo by Tima Miroshnichenko on Pexels In the world of investing, the term \u201cmultibagger\u201d refers to stocks that have the potential to deliver returns several times greater than the original investment. One key factor that can help identify potential multibaggers is momentum. Momentum investing focuses on capitalizing on the continuation of existing market trends. Investors using this strategy look for stocks that are experiencing upward price movements, often driven by strong earnings reports, positive news, industry tailwinds, or overall market sentiment. The idea is simple: \u201cthe trend is your friend,\u201d and momentum can be a powerful force in identifying winners before they peak. The importance of momentum has been recognized by famous investors, but many of them emphasized the idea that it is crucial to catch momentum stocks early on. As Warren Buffett put it \u2013 \u201cWhat the wise do in the beginning, fools do in the end\u201d. Carl Icahn David Einhorn Warren Buffett Paul Tudor Jones Stock Price Return in the last twelve months: 522% Icahn Capital LP $77,426,184,000 Paulson & Co Leon Cooperman Berkshire Hathaway The aforementioned developments have caused a market selloff, particularly in previously high-momentum stocks such as the Magnificent 8, which have benefited from the AI megatrend and were responsible for most of the market returns last year. Prior to that, many previously well-performing stocks, such as government contractors, had already lost their momentum following the election results, while some of the few well-performing healthcare stocks were hit by Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement threats. Likewise, the energy sector remained somewhat out of favor \u2013 despite volume tailwinds from Trump 2.0, the expectation of lower oil prices amid a weaker economy has put downward pressure on stock prices in the sector. The key takeaway for investors is that one should look for multibaggers that haven\u2019t yet lost their momentum during the market dip in the last month. These are often lower-capitalization companies that are underfollowed by analysts and operate in high-growth markets. In this article, we will take a detailed look at 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy in 2025. Returns since its inception in May 2014 (through February 19th, 2025) $1,491,303,000 Root, Inc.

The US market is close to entering a correction mode as the absolute magnitude of decline since the mid-February peak is approaching 10%. The current policies of the new US administration, such as tariffs, federal jobs cuts and cuts in some large-scale public projects, are causing havoc among investors as many are fearing a scenario in which the US economy enters stagflation \u2013 a period of high inflation among weak economic growth and unemployment. Some analysts have pointed out that sectors reliant on government contracts, such as infrastructure and defense, are already experiencing heightened volatility as a result of these policy shifts. In a recent interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News, the President himself refused to rule out a recession in the current year and claimed that the economy is in \u201ca period of transition\u201d and that tariffs might fuel inflation at some point. With consumer confidence showing early signs of weakening, as signaled by recent business surveys, some economists argue that the Federal Reserve may be forced to intervene sooner than expected to stabilize the markets. This idea was already supported by the President, who at some point expressed the opinion that interest rates in the US economy are higher than they should be.

Soros Fund Management", "https://tass.com/pressreview/1926457": " At the same time, despite US support and control over oil resources, Syrian Kurds face persistent pressure from Turkey, which has forced them to engage in dialogue with Damascus, the expert added. The escalating trade wars under the Trump administration heighten the risk of a recession for the US economy, prompting investors to seek safer assets, senior portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital Ilya Golubov told Vedomosti. As a result, capital has shifted toward US Treasury bonds and gold, he added. \"Ukraine is deliberately seeking to sabotage the negotiation process while avoiding direct responsibility. The objective is to provoke Russia into responding in a manner that Washington could frame as excessive,\" Loshkarev explained. \"The discussion surrounding Starlink is mere doublespeak - no one is actually disabling it. A strike at this range would require satellite coordination,\" he said. \"This will be confirmed when Starlink routers are found among the remains of downed UAVs, as they were likely used to guide the drones to their targets. Evidently, this was designed as a large-scale, coordinated assault,\" he noted, adding that Russia\u2019s air defenses have markedly improved - had such an attack occurred a year ago, it would have posed a far greater threat. On March 11, Trump directed the Commerce Department to impose an additional 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum from Canada in response to Ontario\u2019s newly introduced electricity levies. Previously, the administration had imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, while also doubling tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%. The US government has further signaled its intent to introduce tariffs on EU imports and implement reciprocal tariffs against nations whose duties on American products exceed those levied by the US. Following the discussions in Jeddah, it was revealed that Zelensky is once again expected at the White House. Furthermore, agreements were reached to accelerate negotiations on rare earth metals. Belova told the newspaper that Europe is unlikely to address its increased gas requirements by resuming pipeline imports from Russia. However, Chinese companies could play a role in redirecting LNG to the continent. As of March 11, natural gas reserves in the European Union\u2019s underground storage (UGS) facilities had dropped to 40 bln cubic meters, representing 36.67% of full capacity. Ahead of the autumn heating season, it will be essential to replenish these reserves while also refilling Ukraine\u2019s UGS facilities, which were nearly depleted last winter. The demand for gas in Europe will be further bolstered by the United Kingdom, which, lacking extensive storage capacity, will require an additional 2-3 bln cubic meters beyond its operational consumption, Rossiyskaya Gazeta writes. Yet, it becomes increasingly apparent that Ukraine remains unwilling to make substantive compromises or territorial concessions, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences Konstantin Blokhin told the newspaper. According to Igor Istomin, Acting Head of the Department of Applied Analysis of International Processes at MGIMO, Ukraine has seemingly given in to US demands regarding the terms of a temporary ceasefire, following an unsuccessful meeting in the Oval Office. Washington has a strategic interest in legitimizing Kurdish autonomous institutions within Syria, as this would enable the US to exert influence over both Damascus and neighboring Turkey, chief researcher at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies Vladimir Vasiliev told Vedomosti. He believes that, in an effort to minimize costs, the United States will likely withdraw its military forces from Syria in the near future, delegating the responsibility of protecting US interests to Kurdish armed groups. According to military analyst Alexey Leonkov, Ukraine was only able to carry out this large-scale assault due to Western-supplied technical resources. Although current gas reserves in European UGS facilities have not yet reached historic lows - being approximately 12 bln cubic meters higher than at this time in 2022 - the circumstances today are significantly different. Two years ago, the EU was still receiving pipeline gas from Russia, with supplies only interrupted via the Yamal-Europe pipeline through Poland. Another major challenge concerns Ukrainian underground gas storage. Previously, Russian gas flowed through Ukraine, allowing for efficient replenishment. Now, with transit suspended and domestic production insufficient to meet demand, refilling these reserves will fall largely to EU member states. Despite Ukraine\u2019s direct acts of aggression, Washington not only disregarded them but also announced the immediate resumption of military aid to Kiev. Meanwhile, Donald Trump revealed his intent to engage in direct talks with Vladimir Putin, with negotiations between Russia and the United States scheduled for March 11 or 12. Additionally, the US State Department confirmed that Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to visit Moscow on March 13. In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry acknowledged that interactions with US representatives could take place in the coming days. MOSCOW, March 12. /TASS/. The US says Ukraine is ready to settle the conflict and has agreed to an immediate 30-day ceasefire following the March 11 meeting in Jeddah; Russia thwarts the largest Ukrainian drone attack on its territory; and the US stock market declines on concerns about an economic slowdown. These stories topped Wednesday\u2019s newspaper headlines across Russia. He further noted that Ukraine had been stockpiling UAVs for some time in preparation for such an attack, whereas Russian forces conduct similar operations almost daily. Beyond cost concerns, Europe also faces the risk of supply shortages in the event of adverse weather conditions, as LNG production in the United States cannot be expanded instantaneously. Securing additional gas supplies will require two possible solutions: diverting LNG shipments from the Asia-Pacific region (particularly China), as was the case three years ago, or reactivating one of the dormant Russian gas import routes. Kiev\u2019s provocation is largely driven by the stalled negotiations with Washington over resource agreements, as the US has been pressuring Ukraine to accept tighter commitments in the peace process, associate professor of political theory at MGIMO Ivan Loshkarev told Izvestia. According to the document, published on al-Sharaa\u2019s X account, all border checkpoints with Iran and Turkey, as well as airports, oil fields, and prisons currently under SDF control, will be transferred to the Syrian government by the end of the year. In return, Syrian Kurds will be granted \"constitutional rights,\" including the ability to use and teach their language and the opportunity for displaced individuals to return to their homes. The agreement also guarantees Kurdish participation in Syria\u2019s political process, regardless of religious affiliation. Meanwhile, the SDF has committed to supporting Damascus in its fight against Assad loyalists and other forces threatening the security and unity of the country. Ultimately, he concluded, this represents a last-ditch maneuver. From a military standpoint, Kiev is no longer capable of launching large-scale offensives and is instead restricted to conducting localized operations. At this stage, the agreements remain preliminary and the success of the Kurdish integration process into Syria\u2019s military and political structures will depend on both internal and external regional dynamics, Associate Professor at the Department of Foreign Regional Studies at Moscow State Linguistic University Iqbal Durre told the newspaper. Ideally, the Kurds would prefer to retain their autonomous political institutions and maintain independent armed forces within the Syrian army, but Damascus remains unwilling to yield on these points. These matters will undoubtedly be the subject of intense negotiations, Durre added. Market sentiment has also been dampened by concerns over a potential government shutdown and fears that the administration\u2019s aggressive trade, economic, and immigration policies could negatively impact the US economy, said Natalia Malykh, head of equity analysis at Finam to the newspaper. \"However, Ukraine\u2019s willingness to pursue a settlement with US backing could serve as a mechanism to exert pressure on Russia, compelling it to respond and make key decisions. Trump likely expects that Moscow may alter its stance and agree to a phased resolution - first implementing a temporary ceasefire, followed by a comprehensive agreement,\" Istomin told Izvestia. \"There is little military justification for this strike. It is more of a political maneuver, strategically timed to coincide with key international developments,\" he said. \"The nighttime assault was likely intended to signal that Ukraine still has the capability for an air campaign, thereby creating leverage in negotiations. However, this does not serve our interests, as Russia maintains undisputed air superiority,\" the expert added. \"Kiev seeks to engage with Moscow solely from a position of strength. Moreover, Zelensky himself is not prepared for constructive dialogue. If Ukraine refuses to accept Russia\u2019s terms, there is no alternative but for the special military operation to continue,\" he said. However, Deputy Head of the National Energy Security Fund Alexey Grivach warns that the situation may be even more complex. By November, European companies will need to obtain 65-70 bln cubic meters of gas - double the amount added last summer - alongside an additional 8-10 bln cubic meters for Ukrainian storage. Exacerbating these difficulties are uncertainties surrounding summer weather conditions and Europe\u2019s fluctuating gas demand. With Ukrainian transit no longer contributing to supply balances, the EU will likely need to source an estimated 60 bln cubic meters of additional imports, primarily from the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. The United States has stated that Ukraine is prepared to settle the conflict and has agreed to an immediate 30-day ceasefire - not only in the air and at sea, as originally proposed by Kiev, but also on land - pending Moscow\u2019s approval. This was reported by members of the US delegation following the March 11 meeting in Jeddah. However, Kiev\u2019s professed willingness to de-escalate is contradicted by the most large-scale UAV attack on Moscow to date, which resulted in three fatalities. This development, according to Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Konstantin Kosachev, demonstrates that Ukraine is neither prepared for a genuine ceasefire nor for peace. Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador Rodion Miroshnik further stated that the Zelensky administration remains committed to prolonging hostilities. Late in the evening of March 10, Syria\u2019s transitional authorities reached an agreement with the Kurdish administration governing northeastern Syria on integrating all civilian and military structures under pan-Syrian state institutions. The agreement was signed by Ahmed al-Sharaa, interim Syrian president and leader of the Ha\u2019yat Tahrir al-Sham group (an organization designated as terrorist and banned in Russia), along with Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). According to Vedomosti, the deal was reached under US pressure and will end with the withdrawal of their troops. During the negotiations, Western media reported that Washington explicitly ruled out Kiev\u2019s return to the borders of either 2014 or 2022. The Ukrainian side, however, swiftly dismissed these claims as \"disinformation.\" Nevertheless, one reality remains evident - the US has gradually adjusted its strategic approach from an unyielding commitment to Ukrainian victory to the pursuit of intermediary solutions, Izvestia writes. At the opening of the trading session on March 11, key US stock indices continued their declines from the previous day, following Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on the economic transition period. By Tuesday evening (Moscow time), the S&P 500 had dropped by 0.44%, while the Dow Jones fell 0.9%. The NASDAQ 100 made a modest attempt at recovery, rising by 0.1%. However, the previous trading session saw the technology index suffer its worst day since 2022, shedding 3.8% in value and losing $1 trillion in market capitalization, Vedomosti writes. Sergey Kaufman, analyst at Finam, supports this assessment, estimating that the EU will require roughly 30 bln cubic meters more than last year. The country\u2019s air defense systems functioned as expected during the raid, effectively neutralizing airborne threats, retired lieutenant colonel and chairman of the board of the all-Russian organization Officers of Russia Roman Shkurlatov told Izvestia. TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews Research Director at Implementa Maria Belova outlined a baseline scenario assuming moderate spring temperatures. Under these conditions, EU gas reserves are projected to shrink to 25-30% by the end of the heating season. To meet the mandated 90% storage level, Europe will need to inject approximately 60 bln cubic meters of gas into its UGS facilities by October, which is more than twice the volume stored in preparation for the previous winter. Vladimir Bruter, expert at the International Institute for Humanitarian and Political Studies, believes that Washington is attempting to impose an unfavorable framework upon Russia, having unilaterally announced agreements with Ukraine that were never coordinated with Moscow. The most extensive Ukrainian drone assault on Russian territory to date was deliberately timed to coincide with upcoming US-Ukrainian negotiations, the Russian Defense Ministry reported. The Ukrainian Armed Forces sought to showcase their ability to sustain military operations. In total, Russian forces detected and intercepted 343 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including nearly a hundred targeting the capital. The attack resulted in the deaths of three individuals in Domodedovo. Meanwhile, OSCE Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu, during his visit to Moscow, assessed the damage to a residential building in the Moscow Region, following a UAV strike. Experts told Izvestia that the assault will have no impact on Russia\u2019s negotiating stance. Uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s foreign trade policy in terms of new tariffs or adjustments to existing ones has alarmed investors, leading to widespread sell-offs and profit-taking, stock market expert at BCS World of Investments Denis Buivolov noted. Moreover, fears of rising inflation due to increased tariffs have resurfaced, raising concerns that the Federal Reserve may delay its anticipated interest rate cuts, he added.", "https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/bad-news-american-beer-drinkers-aluminium-tariffs-kick-andy-home-2025-03-12/": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-targets-tiny-border-transfers-in-trump-s-war-on-mexico-gangs-11741737726475.html": "\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.

The drug does not have the addiction risks associated with opioid painkillers and delivers excellent pain relief, ranking this oral non-opioid pain signal inhibitor among the first new class of pain medicine in over 20 years. David Tepper Experts are attributing several reasons to this trend. Some believe that Chinese pharmaceutical companies are attracting attention because of their advanced development capabilities that are producing effective molecules in substantial quantities. These Chinese companies are also in a position to assign a lower price to these medicines compared to the US, and are capable of initiating their testing on human subjects quicker. According to CNBC, buyers have devised a business model allowing them to import medicines through licensing deals. Biotech companies are further pushed into making these deals due to the drying up of venture funding in China. \u201cOn February 20, Emily Field, Head of European Pharma Research at Barclays, appeared on CNBC to discuss the dynamics of the pharmaceutical sector, the impact of US tariffs, and the performance of obesity drugs.

However, there are still several questions surrounding the performance of obesity drugs, as major players in the domain have exhibited contrasting previous year performance. Tudor Investment Corp Carl Icahn In this article, we will look at the 11 Best Pharma Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. David Einhorn Warren Buffett While the company\u2019s products are under pressure due to competition for its Eylea franchise, analysts believe Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:REGN) stock could grow by 50% from its current levels in the next year. This optimism is because, despite pressures, the company grew its total revenue by 10% year-over-year to $3.8 billion in fiscal Q4 2024. The positive performance was primarily due to Dupixent, which recorded a 15% year-over-year growth in its worldwide net sales to $3.7 billion in fiscal Q4 2024. Paul Tudor Jones Icahn Capital LP $77,426,184,000 Although the potential reasons for this trend vary, experts believe this scenario is here to stay. While it is anticipated to affect the US pharmaceutical sector, how these repercussions might materialize is unclear. Some experts believe it could ruin American startups if large pharmaceutical companies stumble upon a promising Chinese drug at a low price; others believe the competition would be fruitful for the industry.

Talking about the tariffs, she said that their materialization poses a big open question for the pharmaceutical sector as some companies assemble their products in the US after manufacturing them abroad. Manufacturing costs are thus pretty low for these companies, which is a significant point to consider when determining the impact of tariffs. She believed that absorbing the additional cost of the tariffs would be very manageable for these companies.

Despite these tensions, both sides have continued to emphasize their commitment to strengthening commercial ties. During Prime Minister Modi\u2019s visit to Washington on February 13, 2025, both countries agreed to negotiate the first tranche of a BTA, covering market access improvements, tariff rationalization, and supply chain integration. The following sectors are under active consideration for potential tariff concessions: India Briefing is one of five regional publications under the Asia Briefing brand.

The second round of trade talks is expected to be crucial in shaping the contours of the India-US BTA and may serve as a stepping stone toward a broader Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in the future. However, Prasad has clarified to the Parliament that no reciprocal tariffs have yet been imposed by the US.

This initiative reflects the government\u2019s commitment to resolving long-standing trade challenges and advancing the shared objective of doubling bilateral trade to US$500 billion by 2030. To prevent any escalation of trade tensions and safeguard exporters\u2019 interests, India is reportedly reassessing its tariff structure, particularly in high-sensitivity sectors such as automobiles, textiles, leather, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and agriculture. Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, concluded a visit to the US on March 7, 2025, followed by internal consultations with Indian exporters and trade associations. As per reports, Goyal is likely to visit the US again with revised tariff order later in March 2025. India has begun formulating the Terms of Reference for a proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US, with the goal of finalizing the initial phase of negotiations by fall 2025.

India\u2019s ongoing efforts to refine its tariff cut offers represent not just a tactical response to US concerns, but also a strategic opportunity to integrate more deeply into global supply chains and attract greater foreign investment. With both nations committed to enhancing trade, the success of these negotiations could define the next phase of India-US economic cooperation, paving the way for a stronger, more resilient bilateral partnership in the years ahead. Dezan Shira & Associates also maintains offices or has alliance partners assisting foreign investors in China, Hong Kong SAR, Dubai (UAE), Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Italy, Germany, the United States, and Australia. While India is keen on advancing trade relations with the US, it remains cautious about overexposing sensitive sectors to foreign competition. The government\u2019s evolving approach appears to be one of calibrated liberalization, wherein tariff reductions are matched with domestic industry safeguards and export incentives. India\u2019s proactive stance comes amid increased global scrutiny on trade imbalances. In a recent address, former US President Donald Trump criticized India\u2019s high import tariffs, calling them \u201cvery unfair,\u201d and threatened the implementation of reciprocal tariffs on countries imposing levies on American goods, effective April 2, 2025. In a written statement to the lower house of Parliament on March 11, 2025, Minister of State (MoS) for Commerce and Industry, Jitin Prasada, confirmed that both nations are working toward a comprehensive multi-sector trade agreement. The proposed pact seeks to enhance market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration. These efforts come amid ongoing concerns regarding potential US reciprocal tariffs on Indian exports and aim to reinforce economic cooperation between the two countries. As India and the US strengthen their economic partnership, the Indian government is actively preparing revised tariff reduction proposals for the upcoming round of bilateral trade negotiations. Media reports indicate that India has initiated work on the Terms of Reference (ToR) for a proposed Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), with the aim of concluding the initial phase of discussions by fall 2025. While the memo heightens pressure on countries like India to reduce trade imbalances, it has not yet translated into direct tariffs. India\u2019s response so far has been to intensify diplomatic and trade consultations rather than engage in retaliatory measures, underscoring its interest in preserving the positive momentum in bilateral trade. Type keyword to begin searching... Trade between the two countries has seen a steady rise in recent years. In 2023, India-US bilateral trade reached US$190.08 billion, comprising US$123.89 billion in goods trade and US$66.19 billion in services trade. India exported goods worth US$83.77 billion to the US, while imports stood at US$40.12 billion, giving India a trade surplus of US$43.65 billion\u2014a key point of contention in US trade discussions.

President Trump imposed 10 per cent tariffs on all imports from China in February and raised the tariff subsequently to 20 per cent. China, she noted, has reduced its protectionist policies especially in the last few months. On private sector seeking protection of domestic industry through higher tariffs, Ravi said: \"Our national champions, the public sector units have carried their weight in the form of major boost in terms of connectivity, or banking but the economy as whole, when you talk of automobiles, various segments \u2013 we have to foster more competition.\u201d Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh has questioned the government on whether the interest of Indian farmers and manufacturers is being compromised by reducing tariffs.
