current HELOC options online now. Updated on:  March 11, 2025 / 12:15 PM EDT/ CBS News The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its next inflation reading, this time for February, on March 12. And it's a critical reading to watch for after the inflation\u00a0rate increased in the last four straight months. Should the rate increase yet again, it could reverberate throughout the economy and cause market concerns over an extended fight to tame inflation. While an increase in inflation won't directly impact HELOC rates, it could have a major impact on Federal Reserve monetary policy, which could affect HELOCs. And it won't take a particularly long time to occur with the Fed's next meeting set for March 18 and March 19, so monitor tomorrow's reading for signs of possible rate changes to come.

Whether you're considering borrowing equity from your home via a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or have already done so and are making repayments, recent months have brought positive news. Not only did HELOC interest rates fall for much of 2024 but they continued that downward trend in 2025. They hit an 18-month low in January, a two-year low in February and then continued to fall in March. Now at just 8.06% for qualified borrowers, HELOCs are materially lower than they were at the start of 2024, when they were averaging 10.16%. Home equity levels were around $320,000 on average last November and have since fallen to around $313,000, according to a March report. Still, home equity levels overall are up around 6% year over year, giving many homeowners plenty of equity to potentially utilize. But this figure can rise or fall, also based on market conditions, and home values can be dramatically impacted this year in certain areas of the country. So this is a particularly important item to monitor now, regardless of whether you're using a HELOC or home equity loan. Since the home functions as collateral, you'll always want to be able to make your payments or you'll risk your homeownership. And you'll also want to avoid overborrowing if your home value is uncertain, which can be easy to do now considering that HELOC rates are lower than home equity loans and personal loans and are three times cheaper than credit cards. Just make sure that your funding source - in this case, your home \u2013 remains reliable during any draw period. A HELOC is a cost-effective and smart borrowing tool to utilize now but it won't be immune from larger market conditions and changes. By monitoring inflation rates, Fed meetings and home equity levels, potential borrowers and existing HELOC users will be able to make better-informed borrowing decisions both this month and over the extended repayment period. Start by seeing how low of a HELOC rate you'd be eligible for here. Copyright \u00a92025 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved. Here are three timely things that HELOC borrowers should be closely monitoring now: Edited ByAngelica Leicht Still, with any product that has a variable interest rate, it behooves borrowers to stay alert, particularly in today's evolving economic climate. So, what, exactly, should HELOC borrowers be monitoring now? Below, we'll detail three timely things they should watch for. The Federal Reserve issued rate cuts in its final three meetings of 2024: a 50 basis point cut in September followed by 25 basis point cuts in both November and December. But when the bank met in January, it paused those rate cuts, and then there was no scheduled meeting in February. So, all eyes will be on the Fed later in March to see what, if anything, it does to interest rates. And while most don't expect changes to occur then, what is said (and isn't said) after the two-day meeting could impact interest rates, particularly if higher rates for longer appear more likely. This, in turn, could affect what HELOC rate offers new borrowers receive as well as the rate existing HELOC users will repay in April. We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms. Watch CBS News And that change in rates is a benefit for both prospective borrowers and existing ones, thanks to the variable rate structure that HELOCs come with. HELOC rates change independently each month, without having to be refinanced, so some borrowers who already have a HELOC, for example, are likely already seeing their monthly payments reduced.", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/10/fed-steady-interest-rates-cuts-loom/82250461007/": "The Federal Reserve won't lower interest rates at its policy meeting next week, but could deliver the first of a set of rapid-fire reductions in borrowing costs in June if rising fears of an economic downturn triggered by a trade war materialize. Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Paul Simao Economists say those policies could drive prices higher and slow the economy at least in the near term. Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cut their U.S. growth forecast to 1.7%, and raised their inflation forecast. Such a scenario could force the Fed to make a tough choice between keeping pressure on inflation by leaving its policy rate in the current 4.25%-4.50% range or cutting rates to cushion the labor market against deterioration. \"Despite a calm exterior, (Fed policymakers) grow increasingly anxious about the rising risks to both sides of the mandate and the institution's ability to resist pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to cut rates should the labor or financial markets begin to slide before the Fed can gauge the inflationary impacts of not just tariffs, but the entire Trump agenda,\" Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, wrote in a note. \"A slow-to-react Fed will draw the ire of the Trump administration.\" While markets are betting on the latter approach, some economists see the Fed slow-walking rate cuts to keep tariff-inflated prices from stoking household and business inflation expectations, which could deepen the chance of persistently high actual inflation. Fed Chair\u00a0Jerome Powell\u00a0on Friday said the U.S. central bank is in no rush to cut rates, with the labor market still strong, inflation on a bumpy path toward the U.S. central bank's 2% goal, and uncertainty high over the effect of Trump's trade, fiscal, immigration and regulatory policies. The Fed has kept its policy rate unchanged this year after cutting it by a full percentage point in 2024. Policymakers will have more data to sift through this week, with a report on job openings due on Tuesday and the release of the Consumer Price Index for February on Wednesday. At least that's where the betting is in futures markets, where contracts that settle to the Fed's policy rate were increasingly priced for quarter-percentage-point reductions in June, July and October following U.S. President\u00a0Donald Trump's\u00a0remarks last weekend about a \"period of transition\" as he ratchets up\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on China, Canada and Mexico. U.S. stocks and Treasury yields also dropped on Monday on concern that his comments signaled a coming recession.", "https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/03/10/stocks-tumble-mass-economists-trump-recession": "\"This is, to me, the biggest self-inflicted whiplash that I've ever experienced,\" Bender said. \"\u200aWhen I think back to the global financial crisis, when I think back to even the dot-com bust, this is the first time I think I've actually seen market destruction based purely on policy uncertainty.\" The S&P 500 is on track for a correction, defined as a slide of 10% or more from a recent high \u2014 and the Nasdaq slumped similarly as of last week. In response to the market volatility, Goldman Sachs slashed its projection for U.S. growth this year from 2.4% to 1.7%. The slump reflected investor worries that a trade war incited by Trump\u2019s tariffs could cause a sustained economic decline. The president, who promised a \u201cgolden age\" of business last month, over the weekend did not rule out the possibility that his trade policies could cause a recession. Advertisement Ric Thomas, a professor at Suffolk University's Sawyer Business School, is not optimistic about the economy if Trump's chaotic tariff rollout persists. The losses are stunning for investors after two years of strong gains under the last administration. Last year, the S&P 500 was up more than 23%, while the Nasdaq rose nearly 29%. Even crypto fell Monday on recession worries, as losses came across most asset classes. \"\u200aIn the 1970s, '80s, '90s, you never really had an instance where you saw tariff policy being used like this,\" said Bender, who co-authored a paper on the economic tradeoffs of tariffs. \"And that just makes it extremely hard to guess at what's going to happen.\" \"It's going to hurt the manufacturing base. It's going to hurt construction, because you import lumber from Canada and so it's going to drive up the price of housing,\" Thomas said. \"It's going to hurt people that want to buy homes. There's just very few winners and there's a lot of losers.\" \"This is, to me, the biggest self-inflicted whiplash that I've ever experienced.\" \u201c\u200a\u200aA big downturn early in the retirement years is always a bad thing,\u201d said Yimeng Yin, a researcher at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. \u201cIf that happens, people need to think about whether they want to stick with a fixed withdrawal strategy, or they need to think about how to adjust their withdrawal, or even lifestyle, to adapt to these kind of changes.\u201d U.S. stocks had their worst day this year, falling sharply in response to President Trump\u2019s tariffs and fears of an impending recession. After the market's close, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement, \"Industry leaders have responded to President Trump\u2019s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy with trillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of new jobs. President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term.\u201d Trump's failure to quell recession fears in a Sunday interview with Fox News was a \"game changer,\" said Jennifer Bender, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors in Boston. With the global economy interconnected as never before, there is little precedent to help economists predict the effects of Trump's policies. \u201cIf you see the wealth of your assets decline when you see the stock prices fall, that induces people to spend less going forward,\u201d Thomas,\u00a0the Suffolk University professor,\u00a0noted. A continued decline in the markets could also affect workers\u2019 retirement funds. The hardest hit would be recent retirees. She thinks the U.S. will avoid a recession, \"\u200abut the fact that the probability of recession has gone up significantly in the last two weeks is pretty alarming \u2014 considering that no one thought that was even remotely likely for the last 18 months.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 900 points Monday and the big basket of stocks in the S&P 500 tumbled 2.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 4%. Adding to the economic concerns locally are federal job cuts, threats from Washington of withholding federal funding in the sciences, education and health care, and news of the chilling effect that's having on the likes of Harvard University and MIT. Americans worried about the hit to their 401(k)s might change their consumption habits, analysts say. Amelia Mason is an arts and culture reporter and critic for WBUR. Over the last month, Trump has threatened, imposed and delayed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, three of the U.S.\u2019s biggest trading partners. Canada instituted retaliatory tariffs, which remained in effect even after Trump put a monthlong pause on planned 25% levies on Canadian imports. \u201c\u200aThe one thing that prevents the stock market from falling farther is that market participants know that Trump pays attention to the stock market,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo that's probably keeping a soft floor under the market right now. But the longer this goes on and the more entrenched he becomes in his position, the more damaging it will be.\u201d The Trump administration put out a press release Monday afternoon as stocks were plunging, titled \"50 WINS IN 50 DAYS.\" It touts policies around immigration, tariffs and companies claiming plans to invest in the U.S.", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/03/11/wisconsin-soybean-farmers-worry-about-drop-in-exports/82228539007/": "A family farmer, Rebout raises more than 4,000 acres of alfalfa, corn, soybeans and wheat in Janesville. \u201cWe have a very rigorous U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and regulatory process here in the United States to confirm that the products are environmentally safe and economical,\u201d Conley added. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China have also prompted\u00a0a trade war\u00a0that could further decrease exports of U.S. soybeans and other agricultural products. With federal funds in question, Conley said farmers are unable to develop new innovative practices to grow their crops as they face declining crop revenues. Rebout and Conley agree it\u2019s important to educate the newest session of\u00a0state lawmakers\u00a0about the importance of agriculture in Wisconsin. Both Rebout and Conley spoke with \u201cWisconsin Today\u201d about the potential impact of stricter regulations in Europe, the developing trade war and other issues facing farmers. And if farmers are suffering, so will the rest of the Wisconsin economy, Rebout said. Last month, Conley led a panel discussion at the annual Wisconsin Corn Soy Expo. The state event typically brings together more than 1,200 corn and soybean growers and pork producers. Conley and Rebout said farmers are also feeling the effects of cuts by the\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0to foreign aid and conservation projects. This article was republished with permission from Wisconsin Public Radio Doug Rebout, who was elected last month as the president of the Wisconsin Soybean Association, agreed that the EU\u2019s proposed regulations could be a blow to the state\u2019s farmers. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to export as many soybeans \u2014 that can greatly affect our prices,\u201d Rebout said. \u201cIf we make $1 we\u2019re usually spending $1.25 to $1.50 \u2014 we\u2019re putting it out into the local economy,\u201d he said. Conley said stricter regulations under the European Commission would be burdensome to farmers who would have to spend more money to verify they are following the EU\u2019s regulations. Rebout is the chair of the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection\u2019s citizen board. He argued that\u00a0Wisconsin\u2019s farming practices are environmentally sound. He said a recent visit to the state Capitol brought soybean and corn growers together to discuss tax incentives for farmers. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here on our farms is safe,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything that\u2019s dangerous \u2014 we\u2019re running a business.\u201d Rebout hopes to use his experience serving as past president and board member of the Wisconsin Corn Growers Association to better align corn and soybean producers in the global marketplace. Wisconsin\u2019s\u00a016,000 soybean farmers\u00a0produce about $1.3 billion worth of soybeans every year.\u00a0These farmers are nervously eyeing new regulations\u00a0proposed\u00a0by the European Union that would restrict imports of crops that contain certain pesticides.\u00a0Shawn Conley, professor and the state soybean and small grain specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, recently told WPR\u2019s \u201cWisconsin Today\u201d that the new regulations \u2014 along with a trade war and federal funding cuts \u2014 could hit some Wisconsin farmers hard.\u00a0\u201cI think we\u2019ll see another big subset of farmers who leave the industry,\u201d Conley said. \u201cProbably not willingly in the next couple of years.\u201d As leader of the UW Soybean Research program, Conley said his team works with a group of farm leaders who are already examining ways to integrate new technologies and conservation practices into their production. \u201cThen, we communicate that to a peer group who can help make those changes,\u201d he said.Conley said cover crops is one way Wisconsin farmers are looking to drive conservation efforts forward by preventing soil erosion and improving soil health. It\u2019s there he learned about people\u2019s concerns regarding exports and tariffs, as well as interest in cutting back on costs due to declining revenues. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking to our legislators, we\u2019re telling the same stories because soybean growers also grow corn,\u201d Rebout said. In Wisconsin, soybeans averaged $9.92 per bushel in January, which was 39 cents higher than December\u2019s price but $2.68 lower than last January, according to a new report from the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Agricultural Statistics Service. Rebout said the price of soybeans is shaped by international markets and demand. Rebout hopes to also expand the use of biofuels across the state to expand access to clean energy and create jobs for local economies. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we continue to improve our production practices,\u201d Conley said.\u00a0\u201c[Then,] we have quality land to be able to give to the next generation of farmers.\u201d He said farmers will likely reduce the use of liquid fertilizer, which is used to promote soybean growth. But maintaining newer technologies on the farm is also proving challenging. \u201cThat would fall upon the farmer to verify that those practices are being done at the farm level,\u201d he said. \u201cThat time cost would come back to the farm gate.\u201d \u201cThat way we have more of a local market for our products,\u201d he said. The\u00a0U.S. Soybean Export Council\u00a0estimates 238 million bushels of soybeans are exported from the nation to Europe annually. \u201cYou cut programs out there pushing our products, it comes back to us on our prices,\u201d Rebout said. \u201cWe can better manage cover crops in our corn and soybean production systems, dealing with herbicide-resistant weeds,\u201d Conley said.", "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4766330-tariff-chaos-opportunity-2-stocks-worth-buying": " This article was written by If there is one thing that Wall Street doesn't like, it's uncertainty.

Executive order doesn\u2019t necessarily halt ongoing investigations The order asserts that the over-expansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement, particularly against American businesses operating abroad, not only wastes valuable prosecutorial resources but also undermines US economic competitiveness, which in turn jeopardizes national security. Follow us on: See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Overall, while the FCPA pause may potentially provide temporary relief for some businesses, it is essential that companies operating in India continue to prioritize anti-corruption efforts. Contrary to those who view the executive order as a death knell for anti-corruption compliance, the legal and reputational risks associated with corruption remain significant, and the global business environment will only demand more, not less, transparency and accountability from corporations going forward. For companies operating in India with ties to US entities, the FCPA is an essential consideration, especially since India has increasingly become a focal point for FCPA enforcement actions in recent years. Fines in FCPA cases involving Indian companies have reached millions of dollars. For instance, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Cadbury and Louis Berger International faced allegations of paying bribes to Indian officials, resulting in settlements ranging from $17 million to $25 million. In addition to financial penalties, companies involved in FCPA violations often face criminal investigations and the risk of debarment in India, which can severely damage their reputation and business prospects. Indian companies (as also US companies operating in India) are still bound by strong local laws, such as the Prevention of Corruption Act, which has been amended in recent years to include strict liability provisions for commercial entities. It should also not be lost sight of that the anti-bribery law in India provides a defence against bribery for companies that have adequate procedures in place to prevent such activities, even though specific regulations under the Act are yet to be fully established. Statutory auditors are required to report fraud and examine whistleblower reports, with a view of ensuring that businesses maintain robust internal controls and anti-corruption practices. Moreover, while the executive order pauses FCPA enforcement, Indian businesses, particularly multinationals, must continue to comply with other international anti-corruption laws such as the UK Bribery Act, as applicable to their operations. Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication. My Account FCPA violations can still be investigated long after the initial act of corruption as the statute of limitations for FCPA violations is typically five years, with the potential for extensions. The pause in FCPA enforcement may result in the US's pivotal role in the global anti-corruption fight potentially becoming less prominent in the short term. However, this does not mean a halt of global anti-corruption efforts. Countries like India have made significant strides in strengthening their own regulatory frameworks and this move may not impact Indian companies as much, in view of the regulatory environment already in place. Business Markets Stocks India News City News Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO News Startups On February 10, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order \u201cPausing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Enforcement to Further American Economic and National Security.\u201d The order directs that US authorities review its existing FCPA policies and guidelines for 180 days; and during the period of review, cease initiation of new Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigations and enforcement actions. While this development has given rise to more questions than answers, it has sparked a lot of interest across borders, especially regarding the potential impact on anti-corruption efforts and corporate compliance practices. This could result in a more streamlined focus for FCPA enforcement, prioritizing cases that involve egregious violations or activities that directly impact US national interests, rather than routine business practices. As a result, FCPA investigations may become more selective, targeting cases where there is a clear and significant impact on US economic and strategic objectives, potentially reducing the scope of enforcement in less critical situations.

Despite the executive order, the DOJ recently indicated its intention to proceed with the trial against Cognizant Technology executives, who are accused of bribing Indian officials.

One notable takeaway from recent developments in the US is the heightened importance of thorough due diligence on third-party relationships to stay ahead in the evolving regulatory landscape. As US priorities shift in FCPA enforcement, it becomes even more crucial for companies to conduct rigorous due diligence, particularly with intermediaries in high-risk sectors or areas with increased potential for cartel involvement or connections to transnational criminal organizations (TCOs).

Home Loans up to 50 Lakhs Credit Cards Lifetime Free Finance TrackerNew Fixed DepositsNew Fixed Income The FCPA, enacted in 1977, is a US law which is designed to prevent companies from gaining business advantages by bribing foreign government officials. The FCPA\u2019s reach extends beyond the US, and it applies to any US company or person, as well as foreign entities with substantial ties to the US, if the company is found to have sufficient control over or knowledge of the corrupt practices.\u00a0 As such, a US company can be held liable for violations based on conduct of foreign entities including subsidiaries, joint ventures, agents, or other third-party intermediaries. Violations can result in significant sanctions, including hefty fines, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and prosecution. The order does not repeal the FCPA, meaning bribery and corruption remain illegal. This pause only suspends the initiation of new FCPA investigations, with exceptions permissible on the US Attorney General\u2019s determination.

Solar cell manufacturing also resumed in 2024, strengthening the US energy supply chain. The utility-scale segment saw historic gains in 2024, growing by 33% year-over-year with a record 41.4 GW of installed capacity. The community and commercial solar markets also set annual records, growing by 35% and 8%, respectively. The residential solar market experienced its lowest year of installations since 2021 due to state-level policy changes and elevated interest rates nationally. Forecasts show that the market is expected to rebound over the next decade. To limit power outages and make your home more resilient, consider going solar with a battery storage system.

The legislation was not put to a vote. Trump has raised tariffs on imports from China twice since taking office in January. China has shown no sign of backing down. They include borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving $41.3 billion in rebates to consumers who trade-in old cars and appliances for new ones.

Zhao, who was supposed to host the closing session, had a respiratory tract infection, said Vice Chairman Li Hongzhong, who chaired the meeting in his place. Chinese President Xi Jinping seems bent on reinvigorating private businesses, which provide a large share of growth and jobs in the country\u2019s state-dominated economy. Years of regulatory crackdowns have shaken the confidence of entrepreneurs and other investors. At stake is the health of the world\u2019s second largest economy, a major exporter of products to countries around the world and an important market for foreign companies from Apple to Volkswagen. A prolonged property crisis has sapped consumer and business confidence, depriving the economy of its past vitality. Now, a tariff war unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump is compounding those problems. How much will be done to translate words into action will only become clear in the months ahead as the ruling Communist Party juggles priorities. What is clear is that a burgeoning trade war with the United States has left the outlook for the coming months uncertain. \u201cIt is unclear how much of a jolt this budget will provide to underlying domestic demand and reflation efforts, despite the sizeable rise in the deficit,\u201d Jeremy Zook, the lead China analyst for Fitch Ratings, said in a report.

Associated Press writer Fu Ting in Washington and researcher Shihuan Chen in Beijing contributed. China has diversified its export markets in recent years, but the U.S. remains a vital trading partner. The greater fear is not the tariffs themselves but the health of the U.S. economy and demand for Chinese products, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, the chief Asia-Pacific economist for Natixis investment bank.

That's down 4.4 points from its peak in December, though still above its 51-year average of 98. The NFIB said its uncertainty index also rose 4 points to 104, the second highest reading. Consumers, however, could just as easily regain their confidence, Baker says. A recession is generally defined by economists as a period of economic contraction indicated by two consecutive quarters of negative growth. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the U.S. real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.3%. But at the end of February, the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's GDPNow forecast for the first quarter of 2025 dropped to -2.4%. One of the co-creators of this index is Scott Baker, an associate professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. \"Periods of high political uncertainty and negative economic growth are correlated,\" Baker says. What we're seeing now, and what is reflected in the uncertainty index, is \"a very coordinated, huge spike in political uncertainty,\" he says. \"It's damaging for the functionality of essential public agencies, but also for a lot of private sector employees and businesses too,\" Gee says. Copyright 2025 NPR \"Despite a lot of uncertainty, there is scope for consumers to remain fairly resilient.\" One thing is certain: The past few weeks have been anything but that. There's been confusion over the fluctuating trade tariffs with Canada and Mexico, cuts to the federal workforce and the looming threat of a government shutdown. Emily Gee, an economist and senior vice president for Inclusive Growth at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, suggests that the Trump administration's erratic policy initiatives have created a level of uncertainty that is \"more than just vibes.\" Currently, the index stands at its highest level since the pandemic. \"What we're seeing right now is that consumers over the last two months ... have been feeling less and less positive about the economy,\" says Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. Trump has downplayed concerns that his seemingly indecisive policy pronouncements may contribute to uneasiness among consumers and businesses. When asked in a recent Fox Business interview about the Atlanta Fed's warning of an impending economic contraction, he sidestepped the question, saying, \"I hate to predict things like that.\" Responding to a question about whether CEOs could expect any clarity on tariffs, he said: \"Well, I think so. But you know the tariffs could go up as time goes by. And they may go up. You know, I don't know if it's predictability.\" Likewise, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment has also taken a hit due to tariffs and inflation. In February, it fell nearly 16% compared to a year ago. He adds, \"Domestic manufacturers are very clear that the president is committed to enforcing broad tariffs and delivering on his trade and tariff agenda.\" When economists search for signals that a recession may be approaching, they usually focus on factors like growth, unemployment and inflation. However, they also closely monitor consumer confidence and business sentiment \u2014 two critical indicators of the broader atmosphere of uncertainty. Since the start of Trump's second term, there has been a whirlwind of policy changes that many economists say has fueled this uncertainty. Nick Iacovella, executive vice president of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which has supported Trump's tariff policy, explains: \"What companies really want is a stable and clear trade and industrial policy \u2014 one that sets out goals to boost the country's industrial capacity.\" Ultimately, the final judgment on the president's policy will be determined by everyday Americans voting with their cash \u2014 whether they continue purchasing cars, furniture, and electronics, according to Hsu. Last week, Kevin Hassett, the newly appointed director of the National Economic Council, spoke to reporters and defended the White House's tariff policy. \"If you have uncertainty about what policy is going to look like\u2026 that is going to cause you to not make big, important decisions,\" says Gerald Cohen, chief economist at Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina. \"If we're already in an environment that doesn't look good, that uncertainty could tip us into a recession.\" \"If we reduce inflation at the aggregate level by cutting $2 trillion in annual deficit spending, that will have a much greater impact on grocery prices than a tariff here or there,\" Hassett explained. That's not to mention Monday's stock market plunge, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop about 2% \u2014 more than erasing the gains since President Trump's inauguration. The Nasdaq lost 4%. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index provides a snapshot of this sentiment. It relies on news articles, tax data and insights from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters to produce a metric that gauges uncertainty at the intersection of economics and politics.", "https://www.zawya.com/en/economy/gcc/private-spending-may-boost-saudi-gdp-growth-to-28-in-2025-m1irwm9v": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2025, mainly due to higher private consumer spending, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Analysts believe that Tesla\u2019s downturn was also fuelled by growing concerns about its association with Musk, whose close ties with Trump were initially viewed as an advantage but have now turned into a liability. Similarly, theNasdaq Composite plummeted by 4 per cent, as major tech stocks continued to face severe pressure. One of the most notable impacts of the market crash was seen in technology stocks.

Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data showed that the bottom 50 per cent of US households owned only 1 per cent of corporate equities and mutual fund shares, whereas the wealthiest 10 per cent controlled around 87 per cent of such assets. However, these measures have contributed to fears of economic shrinkage, as evidenced by real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The indicators suggest that the US economy may already be contracting. David Mericle, Chief US Economist at Goldman Sachs, slashed his forecast for the country\u2019s economic growth to 1.7 per cent from the earlier estimated 2.2 per cent for the end of 2025, noting that tariffs posed a more significant threat than previously anticipated, reported AP. Tesla, led by Elon Musk, faced an even sharper decline of 15.4 per cent, bringing its total loss for 2025 to 45 per cent. In response to the market turbulence, investors flocked to safer assets like US Treasury bonds, causing their prices to rise sharply and yields to fall. The ripple effect was driven by investor fears that Trump\u2019s trade tariffs would also negatively impact the global economy, especially economies heavily reliant on US exports. Market analysts have attributed the widespread panic touncertainty over Trump\u2019s continued push for protectionist trade policies, which have disrupted supply chains, manufacturing, and investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 890 points, or 2.1 per cent, after trimming an earlier loss of more than 1,100 points. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, responded to the market concerns by stating that Trump\u2019s economic agenda has led to \u201ctrillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of jobs.\u201d Nevertheless, investor sentiment continues to fluctuate as companies remain cautious about the long-term impact of tariffs and reduced government spending. Other major companies dependent on consumer spending also suffered severe losses. Cruise-line operator Carnival Corporation dropped 7.6 per cent, while United Airlines slid by 6.3 per cent. The declining consumer confidence in the US economy has put severe pressure on businesses reliant on discretionary spending. The sell-off was largely driven by growing concerns over President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies, combined with economic uncertainties fuelled by potential government spending cuts and workforce reductions. Also Watch: In China, the Shanghai Composite declined by 0.4 per cent, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell by 0.9 per cent. Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sell-off, which resulted in a staggering $4 trillion loss in market value, has cast a shadow over the US economy and hastriggered fears of a recession. As the week progresses, market participants are closely watching whether lawmakers can pass a funding bill to prevent a partial government shutdown and how Trump\u2019s policies will evolve to stabilise the economy. Wall Street remains highly volatile, with many anticipating further declines if policy uncertainty persists. Goldman Sachs has now increased the probability of a recession within the next year to 20 per cent, citing the increasing uncertainty in fiscal and trade policy. Trump\u2019s administration has been pushing for a series of economic policies aimed at limiting government spending, cutting the federal workforce, and boosting domestic manufacturing.

To determine if Stretch is a fit for you, consider these questions: Debt management focus: Unlike some general budgeting apps, Stretch provides specific tools for monitoring and reducing debt, including credit score visibility. Stretch Financial Wellness is an app designed to help users manage their finances with a focus on debt management, real-time insights and guidance for making financial progress. Stretch does have notable advantages, including its user-friendly interface, emphasis on progress over perfection and the ability to make payments directly through the app. Unlike some competitors, it offers a free version, albeit with significant limitations. Financial education: Learn what you need to know with easy-to-understand info designed to boost your financial confidence and knowledge. The competitive budgeting app landscape includes alternatives like You Need a Budget (YNAB) and PocketGuard, which offer similar benefits at comparable price points. Before committing, you can take advantage of Stretch\u2019s free trial period to determine if its features align with your financial management style. This hands-on experience will reveal whether the app\u2019s interface, notification system and debt-tracking capabilities provide genuine value for your situation. Stretch includes features for tracking debt, monitoring credit scores and creating payment plans that may help with credit card debt management. Though marketed as a comprehensive financial wellness tool, Stretch may not adequately serve those with complex financial situations due to its limited personalization and absence of human advisor support. Advertisement Categorized spending insights: The app organizes spending into categories to help users understand spending patterns and make adjustments. This financial literacy gap is reflected in Americans\u2019 saving habits. According to\u00a0Bankrate\u2019s 2024 Emergency Savings Report, 32 percent of consumers have less money in savings than they did a year ago, and 9 percent say they have no savings at all. The $12.99 monthly fee for the Vision subscription may be counterproductive for budget-conscious users, especially since the free version only supports one credit card. Considering the average American has 3.84 credit cards, many users would need to upgrade to the paid plan for full functionality. Financial marketplace: Users can explore financial products from selected institutions, including credit cards, loans, bank accounts and more. Customized goal setting: Define and track goals like saving for an emergency fund, staying within a budget or paying off debt. Can Stretch help pay off credit card debt? Stretch Financial Wellness (simply known as \u201cStretch\u201d) aims to take financial management further by focusing on where your money can take you rather than just showing how you spend it. Let\u2019s examine Stretch\u2019s features, benefits and limitations to help you determine if it\u2019s right for your financial goals. Reputable budgeting apps typically employ secure encryption and follow privacy standards to protect financial data. Before signing up for any financial service, verify its security features and privacy policy. Financial stress affects more than your bank account. According to the American Psychological Association, 63 percent of Americans cite money as a significant source of stress. This stress can impact mental health, daily functioning and even physical wellbeing. Are budgeting apps trustworthy? Real-time insights: Get up-to-date notifications on your spending and savings so you can adjust in the moment. The app provides tools to help users understand their financial situation, plan for the future and work toward personal financial goals. It approaches financial management by breaking down complex concepts into more manageable steps and providing actionable insights. Stretch aims to differentiate itself from standard budgeting apps by offering more comprehensive tools for financial management. While budgeting apps are plentiful, Stretch offers several useful features: Stretch offers a 7-day free trial, after which the Vision subscription costs $9.99 monthly for the first three months with promotional code SAVE3FOR3. Regular pricing is $12.99 monthly. Financial wellness extends beyond money management \u2014 it\u2019s about having the freedom to make choices that improve your quality of life without constant financial worry. Whether handling unexpected expenses or saving for long-term goals, financial wellness provides greater control over your money and increased peace of mind. But there\u2019s good news: Working toward financial goals, such as debt reduction or emergency fund building, typically correlates with increased confidence and security regardless of income level. Financial wellness creates stability that can improve overall quality of life. In these cases, you might be better served by financial planning software with more advanced features, consulting with a financial advisor, or using free spreadsheet templates designed for budgeting. For premium support please call: Have basic budgeting apps failed to give you the structure and motivation you need? Do you need guidance to develop better financial habits but don\u2019t want to hire a financial advisor? Centralized dashboard: The Vision subscription allows users to link banking accounts, credit cards and various debts including student loans, car loans and mortgages. In behavioral economics, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cnudging\u201d \u2014 small, thoughtful prompts that help us make better decisions without being intrusive. Budgeting apps often claim to be that nudge, but not all of them deliver. Some simply log your spending after the fact, while others try to guide you toward smarter money habits in real time. Would real-time spending insights and reminders help you make better financial decisions? In-app notifications: Through text or email, Stretch provides reminders about financial goals and payments. Is debt management (especially credit cards) a primary financial goal for you? Do you prefer having all your accounts \u2014 loans, credit cards and savings \u2014 visible in one dashboard? Does Stretch charge fees for its features? Users with debt from smaller lenders using less advanced technology may find that Stretch doesn\u2019t fully integrate with these institutions. Similarly, those managing finances across multiple countries will likely find the app insufficient for their needs, as Stretch isn\u2019t designed to handle international financial complexities. If you\u2019re particularly focused on debt management and benefit from real-time feedback, Stretch\u2019s comprehensive dashboard might justify its $12.99 monthly subscription cost. The app can serve as a middle ground between basic free budgeting tools and more expensive financial advisory services. If you answered yes to most of these questions, Stretch could be beneficial. However, consider alternative solutions if you have complex financial circumstances requiring personalized advice, manage finances across international borders, are already comfortable using spreadsheets or other low-cost alternatives, or find that the subscription cost doesn\u2019t fit your budget. Stretch offers these key features: That said, Stretch isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution for financial planning or budgeting. While it offers helpful features, there are some limitations to consider. The 2024 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index shows that financial literacy in the U.S. has remained at about 50 percent for eight years, with a 2 percent decline in the past two years. This knowledge gap often leads to financial decisions that can make progress difficult.", "https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/11/covid-5-year-anniversary-compare-pandemic-response-to-opioid-overdose-epidemic/": " But none of these efforts ever came close to matching the scope of the federal drive that resulted in the first Americans receiving vaccines in December 2020, less than a year after Covid-19 made its presence known. By Associated Press Reporting from the frontiers of health and medicine By Lev Facher The country\u2019s response to the two crises, however, is a jarring case study in the singular nature of America\u2019s Covid-19 response \u2014 and by contrast, how little attention people pay to the addiction crisis. Complete your personal information for a more tailored experience Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Company March 11, 2025 Yet in dominating the early 2020s, Covid-19 also distracted from what is arguably a more significant public health emergency. Even at the height of the pandemic, more young Americans died of drug overdose than Covid. And in the last year, the overall death toll from the country\u2019s drug crisis has exceeded the Covid-19 pandemic as the deadliest health event this generation. Drug deaths\u2019 reemergence as the No. 1  driver of accidental deaths in the past quarter-century is a grim reminder that the overdose crisis continues largely unabated. In recent decades, waves of addiction and overdose driven first by prescription painkillers, then heroin, then fentanyl, and now a deadly mix of fentanyl and stimulants has destroyed families, significantly slowed the U.S. economy, and even shortened the country\u2019s overall life expectancy. In interviews, leading addiction experts at medical societies, government research agencies, and nonprofit advocacy groups uniformly agreed that the country has failed to adequately respond to the overdose crisis since it began around 1999. They assigned blame to a number of factors: fragmented leadership, stigma and misinformation about addiction, failure to recognize it as a medical condition. Most acutely, they argued that many Americans simply lack sympathy or a sense of urgency \u2014 and above all, the efforts that do exist generally lack the funds they need to be truly effective. Since the coronavirus outbreak was acknowledged as a pandemic exactly five years ago, the pandemic has killed well over 1 million Americans, derailed the global economy, and sparked political upheaval that continues today. It also yielded what many hail as the greatest scientific accomplishment in human history: the development of effective vaccines in under a year. But McCarthy, the Faces & Voices of Recovery CEO, said the settlement funds process so far has fallen short of its potential, and that the spending strategy hasn\u2019t been guided by the type of sweeping, transformative vision the current crisis requires. More Home Over 1.25 million people have died of non-alcohol drug overdose between 1999 and 2024, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting the crisis a tick ahead of overall U.S. deaths from Covid-19. With roughly 85,000 overdose deaths still occurring annually, the gap is sure to grow. Don't miss out In an interview, Volkow, the NIDA director, said it was difficult to attribute the declining death rates to a single cause, citing a combination of factors including a less toxic drug supply and the fact that the crisis has already claimed the lives of many of the most vulnerable drug users. She underscored, too, that improved access to certain treatment and harm reduction measures has worked as intended, resulting in greater medication uptake and fewer fatal overdoses. Share options \u201cThere\u2019s decades of literature making it clear that addiction is a chronic illness, but I don\u2019t know that everyone thinks of it that way,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cThere was very clear alignment that a virus-driven pandemic is a medical illness. It really wasn\u2019t up for debate.\u201d Not all addiction-related news is cause for despair, however. After peaking in early 2023, drug deaths began to plummet, and the rolling 12-month death toll has steadily dropped for each period the CDC has published data, with the most recent update showing a continued decline through last September. By Megan Molteni But she cautioned that the declining deaths are not happening universally \u2014 deaths are still on the rise in specific states, like Nevada and Alaska, as well as in specific demographic groups, including among Black and Native American people. In the immediate response to Covid, public officials encouraged strict social isolation protocols, poured billions into the development of vaccines and therapeutics, and then spent billions more on support programs for Americans suffering in the wake of Covid-related economic collapse. Brian Hurley, the president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, argued in an interview that even the medications that already exist, like methadone and buprenorphine, remain underutilized, and the federal government hasn\u2019t done enough to encourage their use. Copy link \u201cAmidst all of this very tragic loss of life in the Covid pandemic, we lost sight of the fact that more young people were dying from drug overdoses than from Covid,\u201d Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a recent interview. \u201cI was just exasperated. \u2026 Nobody was paying attention, or putting in the resources necessary to actually treat them, and prevent those deaths.\u201d The 2020s have inarguably been Covid-19\u2019s decade. By Kay Lazar and Liz Kowalczyk \u2014 Boston Globe By Gairik Sachdeva Another factor that could explain the gap in response, Hurley said, is that many Americans\u2019 attitude toward people who use drugs remains more moralistic than compassionate. \u201cThe call to action really has to get some funding support behind it,\u201d said Patty McCarthy, the CEO of the nonprofit advocacy group Faces & Voices of Recovery. \u201cWe know what we need to do. We don\u2019t need to continue to debate the solutions. We just need to put a coordinated effort behind it to make a system that works for everyone.\u201d Doximity Reprints Your data will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

X Lev Facher \u201cWhen you look at the adoption and spread of vaccination versus the adoption and spread of medications for opioid use disorder, they\u2019re light years apart,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not in any way taking away from that considerable investment in vaccination technology, but we would love to see big, bold action around access to addiction medications.\u201d Lev Facher covers the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis. Account The availability of Covid-level funding, too, could soon become a reality, thanks to billions of dollars that have begun to flow toward states, local and tribal governments, from settlements reached by drug manufacturers and distributors who played a role in accelerating the opioid crisis in the 1990s and early 2000s. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a really missed opportunity to do something significant,\u201d she said. \u201cIsolation kills, stigma kills, and we could do better.\u201d Even if urgency is lacking, the impact of the problem reverberates. Beyond the death toll, some estimates say drug addiction causes economic damage equivalent to 2% of the gross domestic product. Overdose deaths skyrocketed when\u00a0 Covid-19 arrived and caused widespread social isolation, just as the illicit drug supply was growing more toxic. While the current annual death toll has fallen well below its peak of roughly 114,000 in early 2023, drug overdose remains a leading cause of accidental death. By Adam Feuerstein To this day, only a minority of people with opioid addiction receive methadone or buprenorphine. advertisement Bluesky Facebook The local recipients often have broad leeway when it comes to how the funds are spent. Much of the money has gone toward direct remediation efforts, like childhood education about drug use, purchasing naloxone and fentanyl test strips, or expanding access to addiction medications. Some localities, however, have used the money for administrative costs or to pad local governments\u2019 rainy-day funds. Much of the money still hasn\u2019t been spent. LinkedIn By Angus Chen Addiction Reporter Subscribe to STAT+ today, for the best life sciences journalism in the industry It highlights, also, a jarring disconnect between the nation\u2019s response to the two health emergencies, and the degree to which the Covid-19 pandemic helped erase what little momentum the nation\u2019s drug crisis response had left. The country\u2019s response to the addiction crisis, by contrast, has been defined more by rhetoric than by action. Four successive presidential administrations \u2014 Obama, Trump, Biden, and now Trump again \u2014 have cited the opioid crisis as a key domestic policy priority. Many members of Congress have introduced and even passed bills on specific aspects of policy related to addiction treatment or law enforcement. The $18 billion vaccine effort, known as Operation Warp Speed and executed in partnership with Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and other drug companies, stands in stark contrast to the continued lack of funding for overdose prevention and new addiction treatment medications.

By Anil Oza and Katherine MacPhail While regulations surrounding methadone and buprenorphine have been moderated in recent years, the medications remain difficult to obtain, as documented in \u201cThe War on Recovery,\u201d a STAT investigative series. Doctors are not allowed to prescribe methadone, meaning the medication is only available at specialized clinics, and few physicians prescribe buprenorphine.

Stocks slumped globally on Monday as investor worries about the potential economic slowdown were exacerbated after Trump did not rule out a recession. He later exempted many imports from Mexico and Canada from those tariffs for a month, creating uncertainty in the markets and fanning worries about US inflation and growth. Worries over Trump\u2019s tariff policies pushed safe-haven gold to a record high of US$2,956.15 on Feb 24. Trump\u2019s tariffs are widely seen as likely to stoke inflation and economic uncertainty.

Foreign investors \u2014 who hold $17.6 trillion worth of US equities \u2014 could be tempted to pull some of their money from the US. However, this may not be the case if a recession occurs. If the US economy slows but doesn't slip into a recession, foreign investors may reallocate their holdings from US equities to US debt, wrote Nomura. As Trump's America First policy reverberates across the world, major economies \u2014 including Europe and China \u2014 are ramping up policy stimulus to boost growth. Their moves could make these markets more attractive for investors. Stocks Monday's selloff comes as investors are already weighing massive changes in the US that have heightened policy uncertainty, including tariffs, deportations, and massive DOGE job cuts. These changes could undermine economic risk growth and increase recession risk, in turn hitting the $60 trillion US stock market. \"Our latest investor conversations suggest that global LO mandates have become more engaged in Chinese capital market transactions (IPOs and placements) of late, and are increasingly motivated to add to the public market given the recent weakness and volatility in the US stock market where their allocations are close to all-time highs,\" wrote Goldman Sachs' analysts, referring to long-only mandates from mutual funds.

The S&P 500 was down 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.08% and the Nasdaq Composite index sank 4%. President Donald Trump's tariffs and tariff threats have introduced new volatility to the markets, which administration officials have indicated may continue for some time. White House spokesman Kush Desai echoed those remarks on Monday \u2014 following the close of trading. RELATED STORY | How auto tariffs could raise prices from everyday repairs to new and used vehicles \u201cSince President Trump was elected, industry leaders have responded to President Trump\u2019s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy with trillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of new jobs. President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term.\u201d Tesla skidded 15% in its worst daily performance since 2020. Nvidia stock was down 4.88% and other tech stocks across the board also saw losses. Economic experts who spoke with The Associated Press forecast that growth in the market would be lower this year due to the volatility of President Trump's tariff policy. Menu Goldman Sachs analyst David Mericle told the outlet a recession was possible, but the risk could be moderated because \"the White House has the option to pull back policy changes\" if they appear to have a negative effect. In an interview on Fox News Sunday, President Trump did not directly answer questions about whether there would be a recession or what effect his tariffs would have \u2014 but he said the market and the economy as a whole should now expect a \"period of transition.\" \u201cWhat I have to do is build a strong country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really watch the stock market.\u201d", "https://www.kunc.org/npr-news/2025-03-11/as-trump-downplays-economic-fears-this-data-shows-people-feel-differently": " \"Consumer spending makes up 70% of GDP,\" Hsu notes. \"If consumers cut back on spending due to a significant drop in consumer sentiment, that would make it much harder to avoid a recession.\" In its latest survey of small business optimism, the National Federation of Independent Business on Tuesday said its index had fallen by 2.1 points in February to 100.7. That's down 4.4 points from its peak in December, though still above its 51-year average of 98. The NFIB said its uncertainty index also rose 4 points to 104, the second highest reading. Consumers, however, could just as easily regain their confidence, Baker says. A recession is generally defined by economists as a period of economic contraction indicated by two consecutive quarters of negative growth. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the U.S. real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.3%. But at the end of February, the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's GDPNow forecast for the first quarter of 2025 dropped to -2.4%. One of the co-creators of this index is Scott Baker, an associate professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. \"Periods of high political uncertainty and negative economic growth are correlated,\" Baker says. What we're seeing now, and what is reflected in the uncertainty index, is \"a very coordinated, huge spike in political uncertainty,\" he says. \"It's damaging for the functionality of essential public agencies, but also for a lot of private sector employees and businesses too,\" Gee says. Copyright 2025 NPR \"Despite a lot of uncertainty, there is scope for consumers to remain fairly resilient.\" One thing is certain: The past few weeks have been anything but that. There's been confusion over the fluctuating trade tariffs with Canada and Mexico, cuts to the federal workforce and the looming threat of a government shutdown. Emily Gee, an economist and senior vice president for Inclusive Growth at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, suggests that the Trump administration's erratic policy initiatives have created a level of uncertainty that is \"more than just vibes.\" Currently, the index stands at its highest level since the pandemic. \"What we're seeing right now is that consumers over the last two months ... have been feeling less and less positive about the economy,\" says Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. Trump has downplayed concerns that his seemingly indecisive policy pronouncements may contribute to uneasiness among consumers and businesses. When asked in a recent Fox Business interview about the Atlanta Fed's warning of an impending economic contraction, he sidestepped the question, saying, \"I hate to predict things like that.\" Responding to a question about whether CEOs could expect any clarity on tariffs, he said: \"Well, I think so. But you know the tariffs could go up as time goes by. And they may go up. You know, I don't know if it's predictability.\" Likewise, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment has also taken a hit due to tariffs and inflation. In February, it fell nearly 16% compared to a year ago. He adds, \"Domestic manufacturers are very clear that the president is committed to enforcing broad tariffs and delivering on his trade and tariff agenda.\" Get top headlines and KUNC reporting directly to your mailbox each week when you subscribe to In The NOCO. When economists search for signals that a recession may be approaching, they usually focus on factors like growth, unemployment and inflation. However, they also closely monitor consumer confidence and business sentiment \u2014 two critical indicators of the broader atmosphere of uncertainty. Since the start of Trump's second term, there has been a whirlwind of policy changes that many economists say has fueled this uncertainty. Nick Iacovella, executive vice president of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which has supported Trump's tariff policy, explains: \"What companies really want is a stable and clear trade and industrial policy \u2014 one that sets out goals to boost the country's industrial capacity.\" Ultimately, the final judgment on the president's policy will be determined by everyday Americans voting with their cash \u2014 whether they continue purchasing cars, furniture, and electronics, according to Hsu. Last week, Kevin Hassett, the newly appointed director of the National Economic Council, spoke to reporters and defended the White House's tariff policy. \"If you have uncertainty about what policy is going to look like\u2026 that is going to cause you to not make big, important decisions,\" says Gerald Cohen, chief economist at Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina. \"If we're already in an environment that doesn't look good, that uncertainty could tip us into a recession.\" \"If we reduce inflation at the aggregate level by cutting $2 trillion in annual deficit spending, that will have a much greater impact on grocery prices than a tariff here or there,\" Hassett explained. That's not to mention Monday's stock market plunge, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop about 2% \u2014 more than erasing the gains since President Trump's inauguration. The Nasdaq lost 4%. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index provides a snapshot of this sentiment.

Last year, more than 20 former employees of Tata Consultancy Services filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging discrimination favoring Indian workers, reported The Wall Street Journal. In 2013, Infosys, an Indian company, paid a $34 million civil settlement over allegations of systematic visa fraud and abuse of immigration processes. More recently, a federal class-action lawsuit found Cognizant, a U.S. company with an Indian arm, guilty of intentionally discriminating against non-Indian employees. \"Conflict [over the H-1B visa] is not new, although it became amplified with the rise of anti-neoliberal politics and anti-global politics,\" Clark said. \"But it's always been there.\" Silicon Valley tech companies have become closely associated with the H-1B program, and the data supports this connection. In 2024, analysis of USCIS data shows approximately 1 in 5 of these visas\u2014both new applications and renewals\u2014were issued in California. Of these, about half were sponsored by companies located in Silicon Valley. Among the tech hubs with the highest concentration of H-1B visas are metros in the San Francisco Bay Area. San Jose comes in at #2 (home of Google, Apple, and NVIDIA) and also has the second-largest overall number of approved visas after New York. The San Francisco metro area (home of Meta, Salesforce, and Uber) came in at #6. The bill built on previous regulations that evolved as Congress responded to mounting pressure from employer groups advocating for greater workforce flexibility, according to Gabrielle Clark, an assistant professor of political science and public law at California State University, Los Angeles and author of a forthcoming book about migration laws throughout U.S. history. Advertisement Story editing by Carren Jao. Additional editing by Elisa Huang. Copy editing by Tim Bruns. H-1B Employer Data analyzed information from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to show where the H-1B program is being used and which companies are the primary sponsors. The analysis aggregated both initial and continuing visa approvals from 2022 to 2024, grouping subsidiaries of the same entity together. To assess H-1B visa density across U.S. metro areas, the analysis used ZIP codes from the 2024 data to match employers to their corresponding metropolitan areas. Additionally, Census data was applied to calculate the ratio of H-1B visa holders per 1,000 residents. While Trump's longtime confidant and former White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, remains a staunch critic of the program, President Trump has recently aligned with multibillionaire and senior presidential adviser Elon Musk in supporting it. Trump even publicly reaffirmed its validity, not only for tech engineers, but also for other qualified personnel, including \"wine experts and waiters,\" the president said during a press conference held at the White House. During his first term, Trump made efforts to restrict the H-1B program, signing the \"Buy American and Hire American\" order to increase application scrutiny and fraud detection. The order prompted USCIS to review its policies for approvals, which made rejections soar. A significant change came with the act's modifications to the criteria for determining an individual's ability to perform a \"specialty occupation,\" including the removal of the minimum requirement of holding a bachelor's degree. The act also expanded opportunities for H-1B visa holders to extend their visas and apply for permanent residency. \"It was a ratcheting down of what it means to be of distinguished merit and ability, and to be exceptional,\" Clark told Stacker. Over the years, tensions between labor unions and employer groups have periodically emerged around the H-1B program, particularly regarding unsuccessful attempts to require employers to demonstrate they had first tried to recruit American workers before hiring foreign nationals. The administration also took significant steps behind the scenes to further hinder the process, according to Forbes. A revision to the USCIS Requests for Evidence process dated March 23, 2017, led to an increase in time-consuming and expensive submissions to USCIS of additional information they needed to make their decisions. This story originally appeared on H-1B Employer Data and was produced and distributed in partnership with Stacker Studio. A \"Guidance memo on H-1B computer-related-positions\" instructed USCIS to essentially deny petitions for H1-B for many occupations because not everyone hired in those occupations required a bachelor's degree according to the Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook. More importantly, many things were left out of public view. The \"H-1B AC21 Denial Standards,\" revised July 17, 2017, along with other documents, had many redacted sections. Whether new regulations will be introduced, either at the enforcement level or through the legal system, remains to be seen. \"It's too soon to tell,\" said Clark. \"I wouldn't be surprised if some kind of legislation proposed by the Trump administration gets going in Congress to make some changes.\" The program allows 65,000 H-1B visas every year, with an additional 20,000 for people holding advanced degrees from a U.S. higher education institution. It was established by the Immigration Act of 1990, a comprehensive reform signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, which created a new visa category specifically for highly skilled workers such as scientists, engineers, and educators. \"You see that the noncontroversial matters are all supported by citation to statute and regulation. However, their most controversial policies lack any such support. It appears that the agency made dramatic changes to H-1B policy without grounding those changes in any law,\" Jonathan Wasden, a partner with Wasden Banias, told Forbes. Proponents argue that the program strengthens the U.S. economy in many ways by expanding the talent pool, complementing the native-born workforce, and attracting immigrant workers who then also spend and invest in the U.S. economy. Critics, however, contend that the program potentially undermines American workers by allowing foreign workers to fill positions that could go to domestic talent. Concerns over H-1B visa changes aimed at reducing approvals have alarmed tech companies and raised anxiety among Indian nationals pursuing career opportunities in the U.S., the BBC reports. Often, Indian companies cite H-1B visa regulation changes as a risk factor in operating within the U.S. market. For premium support please call: The presence of Indian IT companies drives up the presence of H-1B visa holders in other areas as well. In particular, the area with the highest number of holders\u2014almost 30 per 1,000 residents\u2014is College Station, Texas, where the large majority of these visas derive from Cognizant's presence. The same is true for Dallas, where the main employer of H-1B visa holders is Infosys. Tata Consultancy shares the Washington D.C. metro area with Amazon. Together, the two companies sponsor more than 20% and 40% of the visas, respectively. Amid economic uncertainty and a slowdown in hiring\u2014particularly for technology and professional services sectors\u2014the H1-B program has once again become a focal point in the debate over American jobs and immigration policy. The program allows foreign workers in specialty occupations to be employed by U.S. companies. On the Democratic side, during his final weeks in office, former President Joe Biden's administration introduced changes to the H-1B program aimed at improving its efficiency and integrity. Shortly after, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders published a critique accusing the program of replacing American jobs with \"lower-paid workers from abroad who often live as indentured servants.\" Notably, 3 of the 5 top H-1B visa sponsors are either Indian companies or U.S. companies with strong connections to India. This aligns with broader data showing that in 2022, Indian-born nationals received 72.6% of these visas, with most working in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. The next most common country was China, which trailed in second place with 12.5% of the share of these visas.", "https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/03/trumps-economy-just-20-days-ago-the-us-stock-market-was-sitting-at-all-time-highs.html": " The economy has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism.

Recession fears are rocking the stock market. GDP forecasts are getting slashed. President Donald Trump and his economic team are facing questions about a possible recession \u2014and failing to ease mounting jitters about the economy. Ad Choices It\u2019s stunning how fast the mood has flipped. Investors who just a few months ago wondered if the economy was perhaps too strong are now bracing for real trouble ahead. The U.S. stock market\u2019s sell-off cut deeper on Monday as Wall Street questioned how much pain President Donald Trump will let the economy endure through tariffs and other policies in order to get what he wants.", "https://www.kunm.org/npr-news/2025-03-11/as-trump-downplays-economic-fears-this-data-show-people-feel-differently": " \"Consumer spending makes up 70% of GDP,\" Hsu notes. \"If consumers cut back on spending due to a significant drop in consumer sentiment, that would make it much harder to avoid a recession.\" In its latest survey of small business optimism, the National Federation of Independent Business on Tuesday said its index had fallen by 2.1 points in February to 100.7. That's down 4.4 points from its peak in December, though still above its 51-year average of 98. The NFIB said its uncertainty index also rose 4 points to 104, the second highest reading. Consumers, however, could just as easily regain their confidence, Baker says. A recession is generally defined by economists as a period of economic contraction indicated by two consecutive quarters of negative growth. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the U.S. real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.3%. But at the end of February, the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's GDPNow forecast for the first quarter of 2025 dropped to -2.4%. One of the co-creators of this index is Scott Baker, an associate professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. \"Periods of high political uncertainty and negative economic growth are correlated,\" Baker says. What we're seeing now, and what is reflected in the uncertainty index, is \"a very coordinated, huge spike in political uncertainty,\" he says. \"It's damaging for the functionality of essential public agencies, but also for a lot of private sector employees and businesses too,\" Gee says. Copyright 2025 NPR \"Despite a lot of uncertainty, there is scope for consumers to remain fairly resilient.\" One thing is certain: The past few weeks have been anything but that. There's been confusion over the fluctuating trade tariffs with Canada and Mexico, cuts to the federal workforce and the looming threat of a government shutdown. Emily Gee, an economist and senior vice president for Inclusive Growth at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, suggests that the Trump administration's erratic policy initiatives have created a level of uncertainty that is \"more than just vibes.\" Currently, the index stands at its highest level since the pandemic. \"What we're seeing right now is that consumers over the last two months ... have been feeling less and less positive about the economy,\" says Joanne Hsu, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. Trump has downplayed concerns that his seemingly indecisive policy pronouncements may contribute to uneasiness among consumers and businesses. When asked in a recent Fox Business interview about the Atlanta Fed's warning of an impending economic contraction, he sidestepped the question, saying, \"I hate to predict things like that.\" Responding to a question about whether CEOs could expect any clarity on tariffs, he said: \"Well, I think so. But you know the tariffs could go up as time goes by. And they may go up. You know, I don't know if it's predictability.\" Likewise, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment has also taken a hit due to tariffs and inflation. In February, it fell nearly 16% compared to a year ago. He adds, \"Domestic manufacturers are very clear that the president is committed to enforcing broad tariffs and delivering on his trade and tariff agenda.\" When economists search for signals that a recession may be approaching, they usually focus on factors like growth, unemployment and inflation. However, they also closely monitor consumer confidence and business sentiment \u2014 two critical indicators of the broader atmosphere of uncertainty. Since the start of Trump's second term, there has been a whirlwind of policy changes that many economists say has fueled this uncertainty. Nick Iacovella, executive vice president of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which has supported Trump's tariff policy, explains: \"What companies really want is a stable and clear trade and industrial policy \u2014 one that sets out goals to boost the country's industrial capacity.\" Ultimately, the final judgment on the president's policy will be determined by everyday Americans voting with their cash \u2014 whether they continue purchasing cars, furniture, and electronics, according to Hsu. Last week, Kevin Hassett, the newly appointed director of the National Economic Council, spoke to reporters and defended the White House's tariff policy. \"If you have uncertainty about what policy is going to look like\u2026 that is going to cause you to not make big, important decisions,\" says Gerald Cohen, chief economist at Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina. \"If we're already in an environment that doesn't look good, that uncertainty could tip us into a recession.\" \"If we reduce inflation at the aggregate level by cutting $2 trillion in annual deficit spending, that will have a much greater impact on grocery prices than a tariff here or there,\" Hassett explained. That's not to mention Monday's stock market plunge, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop about 2% \u2014 more than erasing the gains since President Trump's inauguration. The Nasdaq lost 4%. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index provides a snapshot of this sentiment. It relies on news articles, tax data and insights from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters to produce a metric that gauges uncertainty at the intersection of economics and politics.", "https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/centre-finalising-export-schemes-to-shield-exporters-from-us-tariffs-125031101060_1.html": "Reference #18.d0643017.1741710538.45986d1https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.d0643017.1741710538.45986d1 https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.d0643017.1741710538.45986d1", "https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/haystack-analytics-eyes-us-eu-for-genome-sequencing-test-expansion-125031100887_1.html": "Reference #18.d0643017.1741710538.45986e5https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.d0643017.1741710538.45986e5 https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.d0643017.1741710538.45986e5", "https://www.reuters.com/world/us/latest-us-markets-after-mondays-selloff-2025-03-11/": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/03/10/mattapan-fairlawn-estates-affordable-housing": "WBUR and\u00a0the\u00a0Dorchester Reporter\u00a0have a partnership in which the news organizations share resources to collaborate on stories.\u00a0This story was originally\u00a0published\u00a0by the Dorchester Reporter. \u201cThat\u2019s the structure from here on out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone moves out next week, the next person coming in would have to qualify under income restrictions at those rates.\u201d Fairlawn/SoMa Apartments consists of a single-story leasing office/maintenance shop and 12 four-story apartment buildings completed between 1965 and 1968 by the Flatley Companies. The unit mix comprises 14 studios, 143 one-bedroom apartments, 75 two-bedroom/one bath apartments, and 115 two-bedroom/one-and-a-half bath apartments with an average unit size of 829 square feet. \u201cWe know there are active eviction cases \u2026 and Related Beal is very anxious to work with residents and to reduce as many of those cases as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hopeful as a city these situations will get worked out with the owner and residents can finally relax and enjoy life again in their homes. They will be paying what they can afford, and they won\u2019t have an owner pursuing eviction cases against them.\u201d Fairlawn Estates, a large rental housing development in Mattapan, has been purchased by a Boston company that plans to keep all of its 347 units \u201caffordable\u201d with the help of a $10 million grant from the city of Boston. The acquisition was announced during a press conference at the complex off of Cummins Highway on Monday morning. \u201cToday\u2019s acquisition is a major step toward protecting our communities and preventing displacement in Mattapan,\u201d she said. \u201cBy securing these homes as permanently affordable, [we are] ensuring that families can continue to live and thrive in their neighborhood without the fear of being priced out.\" Boston\u2019s housing chief Sheila Dillon said: \u201cThe long-term affordability on this number of units is wonderful, especially along an area where there is new rapid transit and gentrification pressures.\u201d Dillon said the deal began last summer when they heard DSF Group might be interested in selling Fairlawn, and at the same time Mayor Wu had just started a program with significant money from ARPA to purchase and preserve affordable housing. The final piece of the deal is to wipe the slate clean for existing tenants who are fighting eviction cases in court with DSF. Dillon said Related Beal isn\u2019t likely to continue those cases brought for non-payment of rent. Advertisement According to the SoMa Apartments website, apartments range in price, with a two-bedroom, one bath, 805 sq. ft. unit going for around $2,650 a month. Existing residents who have been fighting back evictions and rent increases for several years \u2014 including holding several vigils and rallies \u2014 said the acquisition brought peace of mind. Goldstein said 174 units will remain affordable at 60% AMI, and 173 units will remain affordable at 80% AMI. \u201cAffordable housing is core to Related\u2019s DNA, and we are thrilled to provide a more sustainable living solution in such an important, transit-oriented location in Mattapan,\u201d said Kimberly Sherman Stamler, president of Related Beal. Mayor Michelle Wu said the community has organized towards this goal for years. Long-time tenants have organized protests against large rent increases and one tenant, Annie Gordon, 75, fought her eviction case for \u201cunwarranted conduct\u201d in Housing Court. Gordon won her case last November after a jury trial in the Eastern Division of the Housing Court. After that meeting in September, DSF put the property on the market with the stipulations of it being in the city\u2019s program, and eventually chose Related Beal for the opportunity. There are also special protections for existing tenants who might be above those income levels, so that no one gets kicked out of their home because of the changes, he said. Those existing tenants will have their rent increased by 2% every year for as long as they want to stay at Fairlawn. \u201cWe heard in early November [that] DSF had selected Related Beal\u2019s affordable arm out of a sales process and so we made the $10 million commitment of ARPA [American Rescue Plan Act] funds in December,\u201d said Adam Goldstein of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with them ever since\u2026 Our $10 million commitment leveraged about nine times that in private market financing.\u201d \u201cWe thought that would induce them to take action because ARPA dollars had to be spent quickly \u2014 by December,\u201d said Dillon. \u201cWe talked with them and said if they wanted our help, they had to move quickly.\u201d Dillon said the city also provided a $900,000 loan from the Boston Acquisition Fund for renovations, with the commitment from Related Beal to commence $7 million worth of upgrades to the property, including roofs, balconies, and appliances. \u201cThe program we\u2019re using is an anti-displacement program, so our intention is to make sure the existing folks aren\u2019t displaced either,\u201d Goldstein said. Fairlawn had been an affordable option for tenants for decades with market rate rents remaining low for years. But after a new commuter rail stop opened across the street, it became a pressure point in the gentrification and rent increase battle after it sold to DSF in 2018 and was renamed \u201cSoMa at the T.\u201d Gabrielle Rene, City Life\u2019s Mattapan organizer, added \u201cMattapan and all of our communities deserve to have both public transit and stable, affordable housing: we shouldn\u2019t have to choose.\u201d The sale is hailed as good news for tenants, who have raised alarms about rental increases and eviction proceedings by DSF since 2018. \u201cThe constant stress of facing huge rent increases and eviction weighed on us every day over the past six years, and it wasn\u2019t right \u2014 but we want people to know that housing is a human right, and we can win the homes we deserve,\u201d said Betty Lewis, of the Fairlawn Tenants Association. \u201cThis is a community victory won by neighbors working together, and it\u2019s not just for us: we hope it inspires organizing for housing stability all across Boston and across the state.\u201d The new owner is Related Beal, who has agreed to buy out the ownership stake in the apartment village from DSF Group for $90 million, in addition to the city\u2019s $10 million, according to Boston housing officials familiar with the deal, which closed last Friday.

Entrepreneurs need confidence that people will buy their products before they commit capital. Investors require confidence in the economy before they buy stocks.

As of March 10, the broad market as measured by the S&P 500 was down 8.7 percent from that all-time high, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was off its high by nearly 14 percent. More declines are expected. These losses damage the wider economy, as investors have less wealth and reduce their other spending. Order Back Issues Gift Subscriptions Staff List President Trump inherited a pretty good economy from former president Joe Biden. Inflation was down but not quite out, unemployment was at long-term lows, and the recovery from the COVID-19 recession was on track to achieve the long sought \u201csoft landing\u201d of steady, sustainable performance. The Federal Reserve, reasonably confident of this path, had gradually lowered interest rates and planned to cut rates a few times more. The stock market was at record highs. In Trump\u2019s engineered recession, tariffs are only part of the story. The most important element is confidence. Internship Program But the multiplier can also operate in reverse. When a person loses their job, they buy less; then the person who works at the local store loses their job. This is what happened after the 1929 stock market crash. Trump seems determined to engineer the mother of all reverse multipliers. If Trump had deliberately sought to crash the economy, these are exactly the policies he would have pursued. Trump\u2019s massive cuts in government outlays and wholesale dismissals of government employees do direct damage and have wider reverberating effects. Universities, research labs, community organizations, cities and towns, and other recipients of government grants and contracts scale back their own spending. Like the stock market of October 1929, the market this year was already somewhat overvalued. The ratio of stock prices to corporate earnings was actually higher than at the market\u2019s peak in 1929. But investors are not just betting on earnings; they are betting on the behavior of other investors to drive up share prices. Trump\u2019s advisers have been frantically trying to get him to reverse course. But even if Trump were to pause the tariffs yet again and restrain Musk\u2019s mayhem, it\u2019s far easier to destroy confidence than to restore it. At this point, the only thing that investors and consumers can be confident of is Trump\u2019s sheer unpredictability. Advertisement News in Education Trump\u2019s engineered recession will increase confidence in one useful respect. It will give Democrats and Republicans, including Trump\u2019s own advisers and corporate allies, as well as America\u2019s trading partners, more confidence to work harder to restrain Trump. Digital Access Search the Archives This week, Trump refused to rule out a recession and doubled down on his commitment to tariffs. Other presidents have had to deal with recessions and even depressions. Trump is the first president ever to deliberately engineer one. As an aspiring autocrat, Trump wants to exercise total control. But he can\u2019t command investors to buy stocks or prices to fall. He can\u2019t command manufacturers to invest. And he can\u2019t command workers losing jobs to go out and spend. follow us When Trump took office, it appeared that his program of tax cuts for corporations and well-off individuals would lead investors to drive the market even higher.

The industry has been at the forefront of technological innovation, with companies investing heavily in research and development. This has led to the development of more advanced chips, such as those using smaller process nodes and new materials, enabling greater performance and efficiency. The rapid pace of technological innovation continues to drive demand for more advanced semiconductors. As mentioned earlier, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies is particularly important as these applications require high-performance chips that US companies are well-positioned to provide. Appaloosa Management LP QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported revenue for Q1 2025 of $11.67 billion, 32% higher than guidance, and earnings before tax of $3.2 billion.

Omega Advisors Returns since its inception in May 2014 (through February 19th, 2025) The global semiconductor industry reported a collective revenue of $626 billion in 2024, an 18.1% increase YoY, as per Gartner. Data centers accounted for the second largest sector for semiconductors, behind Smartphones, with revenues in this sector nearly doubling from $64.8 billion in 2023 to $112 billion in 2024. The International Data Corporation estimated that global demand for semiconductors will grow by 15% in 2025. The overall health of the global economy also plays a role in the performance of the semiconductor sector. Economic downturns can lead to decreased demand for electronic devices, which in turn reduces demand for semiconductors. Conversely, periods of economic growth can boost demand for semiconductors and create opportunities for US companies. With the election of President Donald Trump into the Oval Office, analysts are confident that the tech sector will continue to show improved performance.

Khaveen Jey & Anthony Goh with Khaveen Investments, estimate this contract would result in a midpoint of 17.5 million unit sales based on unit sales of iPhone SE4 and iPhone SE3. This means QCOM must diversify its revenue from Apple in order to sustain future growth. It must be noted that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\u2019s biggest clients are Samsung, Huawei, & Xiaomi, thus off-setting the company\u2019s production lines from Apple to these giants of telecom. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) management reported robust growth in Android smartphone revenue, projecting a 20% year-over-year increase in fiscal 2024.CFO and COO Akash Palkhiwala stated: Icahn Capital LP $1,491,303,000 The semiconductor industry is highly competitive, with companies from other countries, particularly in Asia, posing a significant challenge to U.S. companies. This competitive environment has led to increased pressure on pricing and a further need for innovation to maintain a competitive edge. The industry is increasingly affected by geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China have created uncertainty and challenges for the semiconductor industry. These tensions have led to restrictions on trade and investment, which can disrupt supply chains and limit market access for US companies. However, they have also spurred efforts to diversify supply chains and increase domestic production, which could benefit the US semiconductor sector in the long run.

At Goldman Sachs, for example, David Mericle cut his estimate for U.S. economic growth to 1.7% from 2.2% for the end of 2025 over the year before, largely because tariffs look like they\u2019ll be bigger than he was previously forecasting. NEW YORK \u2014 (AP) \u2014 The U.S. stock market's sell-off  cut deeper on Monday as Wall Street questioned how much pain President Donald Trump will let the economy  endure through tariffs and other policies in order to get what he wants. It\u2019s not just stocks struggling. Investors are sending prices lower for all kinds of investments whose momentum had earlier seemed nearly impossible to stop at times, such as bitcoin.

Stocks of companies that depend on U.S. households feeling good enough about their finances to spend also fell sharply. Cruise-ship operator Carnival dropped 7.6%, and United Airlines lost 6.3%.

Asked over the weekend whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News Channel: \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.\" He then added, \"It takes a little time. It takes a little time.\" Trump says he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, among other reasons he's given for tariffs. His Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has also said the economy may go through a \"detox\" period as it weans off an addiction to spending by the government. The White House is trying to limit federal spending, while also cutting the federal workforce and increasing deportations, which could hinder the job market. Instead, investors have bid up U.S. Treasury bonds as they look for things whose prices can hold up better when the economy is under pressure. That has sent prices for Treasurys sharply higher, which in turn has sent down their yields. Elon Musk's Tesla fell 15.4% to deepen its loss for 2025 to 45%. After getting an initial post-election bump  on hopes that Musk's close relationship with Trump would help the electric-vehicle company, the stock has slumped on worries that its brand has become intertwined  with Musk. Protests against the U.S. government's efforts to cull its workforce  and other moves have targeted Tesla dealerships, for example. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 890 points, or 2.1%, after paring an earlier loss of more than 1,100, while the Nasdaq composite skidded by 4%. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% to drag it close to 9% below its all-time high, which was set just last month. At one point, the S&P 500 was down 3.6% and on track for its worst day since 2022. That's when the highest inflation in generations was shredding budgets and raising worries about a possible recession that ultimately never came. \u201cThere are always multiple forces at work in the market, but right now, almost all of them are taking a back seat to tariffs,\u201d according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.

The U.S. job market is still showing stable hiring at the moment, to be sure, and the economy ended last year running at a solid rate. But economists are marking down their forecasts for how the economy will perform this year. The economy has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism. And a widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta  suggests the U.S. economy may already be shrinking. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The result: a period referred to as the Great Reshuffling, as workers were able to reap the benefits of employers competing for their attention. Unfortunately, a \u201chot\u201d labor market like this is unsustainable \u2014 employers increase wages to attract and keep talent, and this wage growth drives inflation. So getting inflation down to a reasonable level after running high will necessarily involve pumping the breaks on workers\u2019 upper hand over employers. As the labor market cools, and even if it remains within healthy territory, people will find it more difficult to find jobs. Evidence: Jobs are more scarce; there are currently 0.9 unemployed workers per open job, compared with 0.5 in 2022 [0]U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployed Persons Per Job Opening. Accessed Feb 11, 2025.View all sources . And if you parse the data a bit, looking at industry specifics, you\u2019ll find some workers will have a tougher experience than others. For instance, though hiring rates have fallen across most industries over the five year period beginning just before the pandemic, they\u2019ve fallen furthest in construction, professional and business services, information and leisure and hospitality industries.

An increased reliance on contingent workers could also play a role in job-seeking dissatisfaction. These workers are less likely to receive robust benefits when compared to employees, and are likely to feel less job security. From 2017 to 2023, the share of workers whose sole or main job was contingent rose from 3.8% to 4.3%, and about 45% of these contingent workers would have preferred a permanent job instead, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics [0]U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

NerdWallet\u2122 | 55 Hawthorne St. - 10th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 Currently, we have a labor market where supply and demand are fairly well-balanced. But it wasn\u2019t that way in recent years, and this difference can make current conditions feel bad for workers, in particular. Measuring how well pay and benefits have kept up with inflation isn\u2019t straightforward, because the conclusion you reach depends on how you\u2019re measuring changes in both categories. Overall, however, most widely used measurements for income growth indicate pay has outpaced price increases since 2019 [0]East, C., Edelberg, W., Steinmetz-Silber, N. Have Workers Gotten a Raise?

And relative to just a few years ago, during the Great Reshuffling, their interactions with the labor market today may feel quite different, and even potentially bad. This analysis examines how individuals might interpret the economy through the labor market, how that differs from economic analysis of the same topic and why those perspectives matter.

However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money. Personally interacting with the job market gives workers some direct experience. Nearly half (47%) of Americans say they\u2019ve either actively or passively sought a job in the past 12 months, according to that recent NerdWallet survey. The youngest Americans are most likely to be interacting with the labor market as such job seekers \u2014 81% of Gen Z, 63% of millennials, 45% of Gen X and 16% of baby boomers. Most recently, the share of people who report that jobs are difficult to get has fallen for the past three months, to just shy of 14.8% in December, versus 18.6% in September, according to the Conference Board [0]Conference Board. Employment Trends Index. Accessed Feb 11, 2025.View all sources . This could reflect stabilization in the labor market, or that the active cooling has stopped. There is other evidence that the cooling has slowed \u2014 hiring and quits rates appear to have leveled off, for example. But some applicants don\u2019t even make it to the communication phase \u2014 41% of active job seekers say they applied for at least one role where they never received a response in the past 12 months. Much of what comes next is outside of the control of individual workers. Despite this, keeping your network strong and your resume updated can make it easier to stay competitive no matter the health of the labor market. And putting together a plan in case of job loss can provide better resilience if the worst happens, as well as a sense of security when things are going well. Because such an array of individual experiences exists across demographics, industries and worker characteristics, there\u2019s no doubt there will always be some disparity between how the labor market is doing, on the aggregate, and how it feels. For example, the current \u201clow\u201d unemployment rate of 4% represents nearly 7 million jobless people looking for work. And for these would-be workers, hearing the labor market is doing well could be jarring. Both of these can be true: The labor market is currently healthy, and many workers are feeling stuck. Labor market outlook: Pessimism about jobs has largely driven declines in overall consumer sentiment recently.

Elizabeth Renter It doesn\u2019t seem that long ago that job searches involved toting around a stack of printed resumes and visiting local businesses. But with the proliferation of technology, and later, the ability to work remotely for many jobs, job searching has changed.

This could suggest the ease of applying and increased volume of applicants has contributed to making job searching more difficult (and less fruitful) than carrying your resume from business to business. Download the app Work in the form of time and effort spent on jobs is what we trade in the labor market. Workers (who supply the labor) exchange their time and effort for pay and other benefits from employers (who demand the labor). Ideally, these things \u2014 the supply of and demand for labor \u2014 are in balance. Economists look for signs of this balance, or imbalance, in macroeconomic data.

This is a sentiment more likely to be held among younger workers \u2014 56% of both Gen Z (ages 18-28) and millennials (ages 29-44) say this, compared to 45% of Gen X (ages 45-60) and 44% of baby boomers (ages 61-79). One possible explanation: Younger generations may be more likely to be at a stage in their working life where wages rise more quickly, and because they\u2019re earlier in their careers, more likely to work in lower wage industries that have benefited more greatly in wage increases in recent years. Despite this overall moderation \u2014 in unemployment, hiring and quits, jobs added and layoffs \u2014 from a macroeconomic perspective, the labor market may feel less well from a worker perspective, particularly when you consider it relative to the worker-benefitting rush it recently had. Though it\u2019s likely safe to say that many of us work primarily in order to pay the bills, the sheer amount of time we spend working is reason enough to attach more meaning to it.

Fund performance: Numbers don\u2019t lie. So while you do your research, take a look at a fund\u2019s short-, mid-, and long-term performance. With the rapid rise of technological advancements, supply chain and logistics reliance, and other competing factors that come into play in the global economy, international markets could retake the lead. For new and seasoned investors alike, taking a global approach to your investments can help provide diversification and multiple ways to benefit from the growth in the world economy. While putting your money in foreign markets might sound complex, there are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) set up to streamline the process and make it easy for those in the U.S. to invest internationally. An example of an actively managed ETF is WisdomTree\u2019s Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund (ELD), which invests in government and corporate bonds denominated in the currencies of emerging market countries like Brazil, Thailand and Colombia. For example, according to Vanguard\u2019s recommendation, a portfolio containing $10,000 in stocks should have up to $4,000 allocated to international stocks. Trading volume: The more liquid a fund is, the easier it will be to buy and sell. Look at how average trading volume compares to similar ETFs. When investing internationally, the first step is to understand how world markets are classified, as each country and geographic region carries varying risk/reward profiles. In developed markets, you\u2019ll usually find countries with mature capital markets, broad regulatory bodies, advanced infrastructure, and other economic stability factors. Countries like the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Japan belong to this category. As a result, their investment profiles closely match the United States. Contrary to index funds, active investing depends on a fund manager\u2019s ability to pick securities and provide above-average returns. As a result, these investments often come with higher fees and greater volatility than passive ETFs. Investments in international stocks come with additional sources of volatility. Factors such as limited market regulation, varying accounting practices, political instability and currency fluctuations could dampen equity returns. Within the ETF sphere, there are two options for how securities are selected: Passive and actively managed funds. There are plenty of ETF screening tools, including those provided by most brokerage firms. You can screen by factors like geographic region, fees, trading performance, assets under management and so forth. As you narrow your options, the key features to consider are: In emerging markets, you\u2019ll typically find countries that exhibit accelerated economic growth, often driven by younger populations, infrastructure modernization, technological advancements and higher levels of consumer spending. Countries like Brazil, India and South Korea are some examples. Although this type of investing may appear unnecessary to some, having assets outside the U.S. can serve as a valuable hedge against domestic market fluctuations and provides the potential for greater returns in both developed and emerging markets. In a passively managed ETF, a fund manager buys a basket of international stocks that make up a broad index. Through a single ETF, you gain exposure to the entire index. This process eliminates the need for fund managers to select individual companies at their discretion. Therefore, management fees are usually low. Investing in emerging markets may present opportunities for higher returns than in developed economies. However, there\u2019s also a greater risk of losses, as these countries tend to experience more frequent economic and political instability. Advertisement Assets under management (AUM): Many investors use this figure as a vote of confidence to assess other investors\u2019 engagement with a particular ETF. Along with AUM figures, it might be helpful to check the longevity of the fund. Depending on your financial goals, asset allocation and risk tolerance, there are various strategies for investing in international stocks. Your level of financial knowledge and engagement with your investments also plays a factor. Like all investments, both domestic and international ETFs carry various sets of risks. Those risks can be market-specific such as stock valuations, or they can be macro risks, such as high government debt levels, which can lead to inflation. The main categories are developed, emerging and frontier markets. After you determine your comfort level, it is time to select the type of international ETFs you want to buy. However, according to Vanguard\u2019s research, investors could mitigate some of those risks with the correct diversification levels. Remember, a sector or region might be hot today and then quickly fall out of favor. Fund issuer: Brands are powerful. And that\u2019s no different in the ETF space. Some investors feel comfortable only investing in large asset managers, while others see the value in newcomers. Decide what works for you and your financial needs. Having limited exposure to foreign stocks may seem like a positive when the U.S. market is outperforming. But when global trends shift, you could miss out on the potential for higher returns and lower volatility. Among the three groups, frontier markets carry the highest risk of political, economic and currency instability. Nevertheless, higher risk generally correlates with the possibility of higher returns, which is why some investors opt to maintain limited exposure to frontier markets. Emerging markets ETF top holdings: By law, fund companies need to disclose their holdings, which is beneficial for investors as it provides transparency. It\u2019s also helpful to decide whether those investments line up with your financial goals. Editorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation. \u2014 Bankrate\u2019s Brian Baker contributed to an update of this article. Some investors also find international stocks to be more attractively priced than U.S. companies in early 2025. The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) was up about 8 percent in 2025 as of March 7, compared to a nearly 2 percent decline for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). Developed markets Frontier markets Once you determine your financial goals, decide what percentage of your total portfolio allocation you will invest in international stocks or bonds. Before we dive into classification, remember there is no single country or region that provides total exposure to the global economy \u2014 thus the case for diversifying internationally. When selecting an international ETF, pay attention to the fund\u2019s top holdings, along with investment distributions across sectors and regions. The key is to align your investments with your desired asset allocation without being overexposed to one area of the market. Expense ratios and fees: By default, most ETF providers charge competitive fees. But even at relatively low levels those fees can add up, so make sure to compare apples-to-apples and read the fine print. For premium support please call: For example, the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU) tracks the FTSE All-World ex-US index\u2019s performance. The index includes more than 3,000 stocks of companies in developed and emerging markets in 48 countries, excluding the U.S. By purchasing this ETF, you aim to replicate the benchmark\u2019s performance. A combination of passive and active managed funds could also make sense for investors with a higher tolerance for risk and volatility. Use the factors above as a guide to discovering your next international ETF. Even if you chose to own large U.S. companies exclusively, chances are you already have some international exposure. In the twenty-first century, multinational companies derive a significant portion of their revenue from international developed and emerging markets. For example, the U.S. market has outperformed international stocks over the past decade, boosted by solid gains in the technology sector. However, until the 2008 global financial crisis, it was international markets that led the way. International stocks have also outperformed to kick off 2025. For most investors, passively managed international ETFs are likely the best option. Intended as a buy-and-hold strategy, they provide automatic diversification and free investors from consistently monitoring market developments. Consider historical fluctuations in market leadership, which usually alternate between the U.S. and international stocks. Vanguard recommends investing up to 40 percent of your total equity allocation in international stocks and up to 30 percent of your bond allocation in international bonds to get the full benefits of diversification. Here\u2019s what you need to know about identifying the best international ETFs and how they might fit in your portfolio. Meanwhile, frontier economies have limited links to the global financial system as their capital markets might be too small or underdeveloped. Therefore, trading volumes are often low and investment participation is limited. Another risk to consider with international ETFs is the potential for overlap in country weightings. Fund managers often act based on market opportunities. Therefore, equity holdings in specific sectors or regions could be similar across multiple ETFs.

If large nations adopt a \u201cmight is right\u201d approach, it would severely undermine the international order and allow the law of the jungle to reign once more, warned Wang in a subtle critique of the US, which has been trotting out expansionist rhetoric under President Donald Trump. The SPC referenced recent high-profile attacks, such as the deliberate car-ramming outside a sports stadium in Zhuhai, where a 62-year-old man killed 35 people. The perpetrator was executed in January. East Asia For instance, the minimum monthly pension has been raised by 20 yuan (US$2.75) to 143 yuan, while an extra 30 yuan per person has been added to medical insurance subsidies. Subsidies for basic healthcare services have been increased by 5 yuan. Chinese courts handled approximately 40,000 cases of telecom and online fraud in 2024, a sharp 26.7 per cent rise from the previous year. At the same time, policymakers saw that efforts to ensure stability at home continued apace - intensifying efforts to combat crime, corruption, and threats to public order. At the same time, China\u2019s courts reinforced penalties for crimes that disrupt social stability. Telecom scams - with Chinese nationals among the perpetrators and victims - ranked among the top concerns, as laid out in the work reports by China\u2019s top prosecutorial and judicial bodies, the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate (SPP) and the Supreme People\u2019s Court (SPC). Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday. The annual Two Sessions are also closely watched for the announcement of China\u2019s defence budget - seen as a measure of how Beijing will expand its military capabilities. In the end, a 7.2 per cent increase for 2025 was unveiled - matching last year\u2019s growth and marking the 10th consecutive year of single-digit growth. The headline figure was some 1.78 trillion yuan.

Senior economist Xu Tianchen of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) observed that officials this time round \u201care frank about the problems\u201d and \u201cacted on them proactively\u201d, citing examples such as weak domestic demand and the birth crisis. China\u2019s youths have borne the brunt of a slowing economy. The unemployment rate among young people aged 16 to 24 declined to 15.7 per cent in December last year, after peaking at 18.8 per cent in August due to a surge of fresh graduates, according to official data. During the press conference that also touched on topics like Taiwan, the South China Sea and the Global South, Wang hit out directly at the US for not behaving as a major power in their worsening trade war. Authorities underlined a broader strategy to enhance overall living standards by strengthening support systems in healthcare, pensions, and public services. What did policymakers try to convey at the tightly choreographed political meetings? Here\u2019s a clue - or several. The US has imposed a cumulative 20 per cent tariff on all Chinese goods, citing Beijing\u2019s alleged inaction over fentanyl flows. China has hit back with retaliatory duties, of which the latest - targeting American farm products - took effect on Monday. \"As the Book of Changes (Yi Jing) advises, you must \u2018use the constant to deal with the ever-changing\u2019. It appears that China is following this ancient dictum,\" he told CNA, referring to the ancient Chinese divination text. As for employment, initiatives to stimulate job creation and bolster career stability were introduced, such as offering people more avenues to start their own businesses and rolling out large-scale plans to upgrade their vocational skills. In a 90-minute news conference on the sidelines, the country\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi made the case for major powers to be globally responsible. When delivering his work report, Premier Li underscored plans to accelerate defence-related projects, deepen military-civilian integration, and enhance the framework for defence science, technology, and industries. China has for years sustained a far-reaching anti-graft campaign. In January, its top anti-corruption agency identified areas such as finance, energy and state-owned enterprises as among the focus points. While modest, such steps are necessary, noted Huang Tianlei, a research fellow and China programme coordinator at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Wang\u2019s pitch was carefully crafted to win over countries by portraying itself as a benign, international player, as opposed to an increasingly unilateral Washington that has been pulling out of international outfits and agreements, analysts have said. Alongside the commitments to economic reforms, the Two Sessions placed significant emphasis on enhancing livelihoods. \u201c(This is) an example of the kind of policy measures needed to improve livelihood and raise household consumption structurally,\u201d he said, while adding that more structural measures will be required to sustain long-term improvements. \u201cMajor powers, in particular, should lead by example in upholding integrity and the rule of law, opposing double standards and selective application, and should never engage in bullying, market manipulation, or plunder,\u201d said Wang, who is China\u2019s top diplomat by virtue of his concurrent position as head of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the CCP. On the demographic front, officials highlighted how people in China are living longer as proof that public health improvements are reaping results, while also highlighting the pressures of an ageing population. Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Officials outlined measures to tackle pressing issues such as housing affordability and employment stability, in order to fortify the social safety net. Chinese policymakers have been increasingly looking to their own citizens to uplift the economy and shift away from a longstanding export and investment-led growth model, but stoking the fires of domestic demand has proven challenging. Doubling down on policy continuity, top Chinese leaders and delegates alike sought to project an image of stability and unity, said Alexander Vuving, a professor at the Daniel K Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. Known as \u201clianghui\u201d in Chinese, the Two Sessions refer to the near-concurrent meetings of China\u2019s top political advisory body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and the national legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC). He also detailed measures - such as enhancing household incomes, easing credit constraints, and stimulating diversified consumption. On a broader scale, authorities pledged robust fiscal stimulus, declaring that a \u201cmore proactive fiscal policy\u201d would be adopted. Copyright\u00a9 Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

On the housing front, unveiled initiatives to ease the financial burden include increased subsidies for affordable housing and reforms designed to lower property transaction costs.

Beijing has consistently pointed out that its defence budget remains significantly lower than Washington\u2019s, while also noting that it has remained below 1.5 per cent of GDP for some years now, below the global average. Authorities have ramped up efforts to dismantle cross-border criminal networks, particularly those operating out of Myanmar. According to the SPC, these cases involved 82,000 defendants. Premier Li Qiang stated as much while delivering his work report at the opening of the NPC on Mar 5, where he set out China's 2025 economic growth goal of around 5 per cent. Observers further noted that his remarks were likely spurred by Washington's increasingly hardline stance on Ukraine - such as a suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing - and its growing alignment with Russia. In 2024, courts concluded 30,000 cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other corruption-related offences involving 33,000 individuals - a 22.3 per cent increase from 2023. Analysts view China\u2019s steadily growing military expenditure as a strategic commitment to deterrence and military renewal, rather than a reaction to immediate geopolitical pressures. This year\u2019s reveal took place as China faces brewing tensions in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, along with a growing Sino-US rivalry. Boosting domestic consumption topped the agenda as widely expected. \u201cThe United States should not repay kindness with resentment, nor should it impose tariffs without reason. This is not the behaviour of a responsible major power,\u201d he said. BEIJING: Championing stability and order in a troubled world, while signalling a willingness to open up globally as other countries like the US retreat - that\u2019s the key message China sought to deliver at its most important political meetings of the year, analysts say. Corruption remains a key focus, with both the SPP and SPC underscoring intensified anti-graft efforts.

Underpinning all these efforts was the conviction that embracing high-tech innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum technology is key to driving national development. China has described this as a push for \u201cnew productive forces\u201d or \u201cxin zhi sheng chan li\u201d in Chinese. Meanwhile, the SPP reported charging 78,000 individuals, marking a 53.9 per cent surge in prosecutions. Deputy NPC chief Li Hongzhong presided over the closing ceremony as \u201centrusted\u201d by Zhao. Li announced that Zhao had requested leave from the meeting because of a \u201crespiratory tract infection\u201d. Calling for the pursuit of \u201cpeople-oriented macro policies\u201d, Li said the government would place \u201ca stronger economic policy focus on improving living standards and boosting consumer spending\u201d. The Two Sessions yielded insights into China\u2019s thinking on foreign affairs while also providing hints on Beijing\u2019s intended global messaging. \u201c(Technology is) going to be regarded as the single thing that tries to solve the low growth problems, environmental problems and unemployment for the young \u2026 it's also going to be the key thing to help China in dealing with the United States and its attempts to use trade as a form of pressure on China.\u201d Upgraded but still having issues?

Here are the key takeaways from the Two Sessions. \u201cEconomic issues over the past years did pose challenges to livelihoods and, at some stage, risked a deterioration in social stability. It looks like the state, alarmed by these threats, is becoming more responsive in terms of tackling them,\u201d said EIU\u2019s Xu. \u201cThis marks a shift from past practice where some problems were neglected, or were acknowledged but left unresolved.\u201d In 2024, courts handled 49,000 cases of serious violent crimes involving 58,000 defendants, including homicides - a 5.8 per cent decrease from the previous year.", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2025/03/10/antitrust-is-the-primary-barrier-to-great-leaps-in-us-payments/": " Up front, lauding as \u201cnoble\u201d the federal government\u2019s efforts to allegedly enhance competition insults reason. It\u2019s already intense as evidenced by the presence of Visa, American Express, Discover, Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, ApplePay, and various crypto entrants too numerous to list. The cost of financial transactions is headed to zero. Whether credit cards, debit cards, person-to-person, crypto, and surely beyond, the costs are poised to fall. ByJohn Tamny An illustration photo shows a display of credit cards on September 12, 2023 in Los Angeles, ... [+] California. Credit card debt from US consumers is rising by billions of dollars amid higher inflation and interest rates, topping $1 trillion for the first time in history, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP) (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) Notable about Visa\u2019s achievements is that they took place in the face of other legislation, including the Durbin Amendment, which among other things price-controlled swipe fees on debit cards to the detriment of users. Yet even with the barriers erected, Visa succeeded in making debit cards the primary way that individuals interact with their hard-earned money. What\u2019s important about all this is that Visa is not done innovating. Evidence supporting this claim can be found in the previously-mentioned truth that victors in any sector are invariably the ones most successful when it comes to driving down prices. All of which explains why it\u2019s necessary for the Trump administration to quickly reverse the Biden administration\u2019s errors. Competition is already fierce, and Visa is one of the best competitors. Rather than saddle it with government harassment, let\u2019s get government out of the way so that Visa can try its hand at inventing a payments future that will vastly improve on the present. In short, Trump should call off the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit precisely because he aims to bring down transaction costs for consumers as quickly as possible. Exactly because production is exploding globally, so are efforts by a myriad of entities to facilitate all this exchange. Despite this, the DOJ is presently attacking Visa for succeeding in a space (debit) that is already defined by enormous competition, and that will include quite a bit more in the near and long term. Which means Visa\u2019s success in debit isn\u2019t anti-competitive as the DOJ contends, rather it\u2019s a powerful signal that it uniquely anticipated a growing market for lower-cost card payments. Despite this, Zelle recently found itself under attack from the mis-named Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), credit and debt card issuers have endured all manner of federal attempts to price control swipe fees, not to mention that Visa is presently the target of a Department of Justice antitrust suit related to debit cards. It\u2019s time to reverse these superfluous encroachments. Even better, President Trump should thrill at doing this exactly because it would involve undoing errors made on the watch of his predecessor, Joe Biden. The good news is that the Trump administration has already gotten started. Even though Zelle was created to make payments and cash exchanges much safer from fraud and abuse, the CFPB made it its aim during Biden\u2019s presidency to saddle banks with the cost of any fraud or theft that took place with the payments system. Thankfully the Trump administration has already rolled back the CFPB\u2019s actions. And while there\u2019s much more to do, the next step should be for it to call off the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) antitrust suit against Visa. Which is why it\u2019s essential that the Trump administration call off the regulatory and antitrust watchdogs presently gnashing their teeth at the businesses trying to invent the future of payments. The above prediction is rendered a certainty by the happy truth that the most highly valued U.S. corporations are invariably the ones that provide the most for the least.

This is an externally facing sector and not homogenous in terms of end consumer segments and geographies. With expected tightness in US discretionary spending but higher spending expected from Europe, prospects for companies in this sector could be varied. Large-cap names had anaemic revenue growth in the recent past pinning hopes on US Fed rate cuts spurring demand.

Since the other global markets are offering better value propositions, global money tends to move there. The US growth moderation and their own high level of valuations may provide some reprieve from the funds flowing into the US form other markets. Though it is not anticipated that FII flow will turn meaningfully positive immediately, with our market correction we may see some balance returning. Our economy is largely domestic facing and hence rub-off from any global growth concerns should be limited. There are concerns about US growth getting affected due to various policies being pursued there around fiscal tightening due to what DOGE seems to be doing and tariffs becoming inflationary and, hence affecting consumption. While time will tell the actual impact, Europe and China seem to be embarking on an expansionary path.

Leading this season is Aboitiz Power Corp.\u2019s cash dividend of P2.35 per share scheduled for payment on March 28, which would also spur retail investor interest in the Aboitiz-owned energy firm\u2019s planned P20 billion retail bond offering in the second quarter of this year. The bond offering is part of the P100 billion shelf registration approved by the PSE. The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) has been enjoying a relative rally these past couple of days, with the\u00a0 PSE index now at the 6,206.55, up from the doldrums of the 6,000 index support level, and at times even below. With the lower than expected inflation figure, there is now speculation that during the scheduled April 3 BSP Monetary Board meeting, the BSP may resume its interest rate easing.\u00a0 However, what may hinder the BSP easing is the uptick in unemployment to 4.3 percent in January after an illustrious 2024, during which the unemployment rate had dropped to 3.8 percent. However, Roxas acknowledges that President Trump\u2019s bold economic moves had caused the US stock market to surge and thus, all market action is there right now. But with the US market\u2019s decline of 900 points as I write this column, stock market players may be looking at other alternatives now.

Even as the US president digs in on his tariff policy, a sustained drop in the US stock market may eventually force him to ease up and reverse his course, or a new trade deal may emerge. First, because of the uncertainties of a trade war, the US dollar has lost four percent of its value. Upon the announcement by US President Donald Trump of the 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, US stocks fell by almost 700 points, prompting a JP Morgan economist to predict a 40 percent chance of recession in the US economy \u201cowing to extreme US policies.\u201d To most Filipino investors this is a surprise, considering it comes with the looming shadow of huge tariffs being imposed by the US against its trading partners Canada, Mexico and China, that similarly threatens the world with a significant trade war that will disrupt the global supply chain. Another big help to the PSE rally is the fact that March is the season for stock and cash dividends of shares. Signup for the News Round now The local stock market rally, of course, stems from events and perceptions of the US economy. According to Eagle Securities\u2019 Joey Roxas, to sustain the Philippine stock market rally, the return of\u00a0 foreign stock market investors is a must as local market players alone cannot maintain the rally. But will the recent stock market rally be sustained? The answer is still \u201cyour guess is as good as mine\u201d because whatever happens to the US economy can change the PSE\u2019s prospects and opportunities overnight. Even as I write this column, the US stock market dropped by another 900 points following the imposition of additional tariffs on China, with Trump digging in and acknowledging that US farmers may feel some pain before they feel the gain that would come from his tariff policy. Let\u2019s hope our economic managers know how to manage the current market turmoil. Even so, Roxas also laments the fact that foreign buyers have been losing interest in key Philippine listed companies, such as those in the energy and infrastructure sector, because of political and regulatory issues that negatively affect the profitability of select companies that would otherwise be of interest to foreign investors. The Trump administration\u2019s tariff moves have, thus, helped the Philippine economy, with local inflation now down to 2.1 percent, much lower than the expectation of a 2.6 percent inflation. The actual 2.1 inflation is the lowest in five years, with core inflation at around 2.4 percent. Also significant to the local bourse\u2019s rally is the perception that local investors fueled last week\u2019s rally. Interested foreign buyers may now be taking a second look at the Philippine market, considering that stock markets around the world are all uncertain of their direction, and with the \u201cflip flop\u201d of President Trump on the imposition of tariffs to Canada and Mexico and an increase in tariffs on China. There is the general feeling that US President Trump holds all the cards in the near future, including the\u00a0 future of the PSE and the Philippine economy. Most significant about the inflation data is the lower prices for food and beverage, considering that the high prices of tomatoes were the culprit in the previous inflation rating. Tomato prices have now significantly declined.", "https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescommunicationscouncil/2025/03/11/breaking-through-the-noise-how-to-get-media-coverage-for-your-company-in-2025s-saturated-news-cycle/": " Human interest and impact remain critical. Pitches with an emotional component and real-world consequences have a much better chance of getting picked up. Of course, they must tie into the current news cycle and bring something fresh. That could be unique and proprietary insights that will grab a journalist\u2019s attention or fresh research, surveys and industry reports that demonstrate the story is grounded in hard data. Brian Cattell, Managing Partner at CLP Strategies, a strategic communications firm with offices in New York City and London. , Forbes Councils Member. A combination of relevance, strong relationships and alternative channels can get your client\u2019s voice heard. Be strategic. Be persistent. And, above all, be adaptable. Newsrooms are stretched thinner than ever before and that makes it far harder for corporate communications professionals to get the coverage they need for their clients. So, how does one craft a media-worth story in such a febrile environment? First, we need to understand the 2025 newsroom. Fewer journalists are covering more beats. Reporters simply can\u2019t cover every story they would have in calmer times, so they are prioritizing fast, attention-grabbing ones. The Trump administration and all the issues it impacts will continue to consume much of the media oxygen. It\u2019s clear there\u2019s never been a greater need for strategic, creative and actionable PR approaches to help break through the noise. Forbes Communications Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Do I qualify? For PR professionals, this means that their pitches need to be strong, original and carefully tailored to the trends that are getting the most attention. Beyond that, we should not forget the power of contrarian viewpoints. Can the CEO or company you are pitching provide a fresh and potentially controversial take on an ongoing issue? Of course, it shouldn\u2019t be so controversial as to detract from the wider PR goals of the organization. However, being too uncompromisingly on message (and, frankly, boring) could make it a struggle to get any attention at all. In this news environment, the quality of your media relationships becomes even more critical. Generic press releases or cut-and-paste pitches are going to be ignored. If you know a reporter well, great. That may help, although it\u2019s not a guarantee of course. If you don\u2019t, then get to know them. Follow their work, engage with their articles and social media accounts, comment and share where possible\u2014before you pitch them. Public relations professionals are rarely the subject of sympathy. But spare a thought for those of us plying this honest trade in 2025. ByBrian Cattell Next, if you can\u2019t get the attention of the top-tier media who are your ultimate targets, consider lesser regional or trade publications. When mainstream media is too crowded, not only are niche outlets a great alternative, but they get the news \u201cout there\u201d and may increase the chances that the top publications eventually will cover the story later. Now, if you are not getting any joy with the mainstream media or the trades, it really is time to get creative. Fortunately, while the news cycle of early 2025 may be the busiest we\u2019ve seen for years, the overall landscape for alternative channels is the most diverse there\u2019s ever been. A large and growing number of influential podcasts, for instance, offer a way to bypass traditional media and go direct to the audience, often an audience that is specifically focused on one industry or theme. Beyond that, there are blogs, newsletters and even LinkedIn publications that can offer attractive visibility. Timing becomes even more critical in the times we are living through now. Most of us know not to pitch something that isn\u2019t urgent late in the afternoon or on a Friday. But put yourself in the shoes of the reporter you are trying to reach. If there are three huge news announcements affecting the industry they cover in one day, then that is definitely not the day to pitch them! Try to find a relatively calm window of time from their perspective, even if that may be increasingly hard at the moment. So, if you are a PR professional fretting about where your next hit is coming from, don\u2019t despair.

Instead, they might consider buying shares listed on it. Risk-averse traders might stick with resilient stocks, while traders with hardened nerves could buy stocks falling today in hopes of a rebound. Commodities Indices Stocks See more DJIA ETFs The DJIA isn\u2019t doing so hot today following news of the escalating trade war. This has the index down 0.94% this morning, building on a 4.56% drop over the last three months and a year-to-date decrease of 1.49%. Another option is buying shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the DJIA. There are options for ETFs that bet on or against the index. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) is one popular choice in favor of the index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) continues to drop today as an escalating trade war occupies investors\u2019 minds. The big news affecting the index on Tuesday is President Donald Trump placing an additional 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada. This brings the total tariff on these metals to 50%. Currencies President Trump introduced the new metal tariffs on Canada after Ontario added a 25% energy surcharge to U.S. homes and businesses. Ontario warned it may further increase this energy surcharge or completely cut off energy to the U.S. The President stated that Canada is a \u201ctariff abuser\u201d and that Americans don\u2019t need cars, lumber, or energy from the country. Turning to the TipRanks DJIA heatmap tool, traders will see which stocks are dragging down the index today. There\u2019s plenty of red to be seen on the heatmap as the trade war pulls stocks lower on Tuesday. Leading these drops are Apple (AAPL), McDonald\u2019s (MCD), International Business Machines (IBM), Chevron (CVX), and Visa (V).", "https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-stock-market-crash-wipes-out-4-trillion-donald-trump-global-impact-explained-13870538.html": "The United States stock market experienced a sharp downturn on Monday, triggering massive losses amounting to $4 trillion in market value. In the wake of the sell-off, President Trump, when asked whether he anticipated a recession in 2025, responded to Fox News stating, \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big thing.\u201d The S&P 500 tumbled 2.7 per cent, nearing a 9 per cent drop from its all-time high recorded just last month. At one point during the day, it was down as much as 3.6 per cent, marking its worst trading day since 2022. Copyright @ 2024. Firstpost - All Rights Reserved Protests targeting Tesla dealerships and doubts about workforce stability have further contributed to the sharp decline in its stock value. Analysts believe that Tesla\u2019s downturn was also fuelled by growing concerns about its association with Musk, whose close ties with Trump were initially viewed as an advantage but have now turned into a liability. Similarly, theNasdaq Composite plummeted by 4 per cent, as major tech stocks continued to face severe pressure. One of the most notable impacts of the market crash was seen in technology stocks. Companies like Nvidia, which had soared over 820 per cent from 2023 to 2024, saw their stock value plunge by 5.1 per cent on Monday, pushing their year-to-date losses to more than 20 per cent. With inputs from agencies Mirroring global trends, the Indian stock markets opened on a weaker note on Tuesday. The Sensex slipped 414.05 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 73,701.12 at 9:16 am after opening below the 74,000 mark, while the Nifty 50 declined 140.15 points, or 0.62 per cent, to 22,320.15. is on YouTube The turmoil was not confined to the US market alone. Asian stock markets faced a heavy blow following the Wall Street plunge. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell by 1.7 per cent, Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 dipped by 0.9 per cent, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropped by 1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data showed that the bottom 50 per cent of US households owned only 1 per cent of corporate equities and mutual fund shares, whereas the wealthiest 10 per cent controlled around 87 per cent of such assets. However, these measures have contributed to fears of economic shrinkage, as evidenced by real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The indicators suggest that the US economy may already be contracting. David Mericle, Chief US Economist at Goldman Sachs, slashed his forecast for the country\u2019s economic growth to 1.7 per cent from the earlier estimated 2.2 per cent for the end of 2025, noting that tariffs posed a more significant threat than previously anticipated, reported AP. Tesla, led by Elon Musk, faced an even sharper decline of 15.4 per cent, bringing its total loss for 2025 to 45 per cent. In response to the market turbulence, investors flocked to safer assets like US Treasury bonds, causing their prices to rise sharply and yields to fall. The ripple effect was driven by investor fears that Trump\u2019s trade tariffs would also negatively impact the global economy, especially economies heavily reliant on US exports. Market analysts have attributed the widespread panic touncertainty over Trump\u2019s continued push for protectionist trade policies, which have disrupted supply chains, manufacturing, and investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 890 points, or 2.1 per cent, after trimming an earlier loss of more than 1,100 points. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, responded to the market concerns by stating that Trump\u2019s economic agenda has led to \u201ctrillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of jobs.\u201d Nevertheless, investor sentiment continues to fluctuate as companies remain cautious about the long-term impact of tariffs and reduced government spending. Other major companies dependent on consumer spending also suffered severe losses. Cruise-line operator Carnival Corporation dropped 7.6 per cent, while United Airlines slid by 6.3 per cent. The declining consumer confidence in the US economy has put severe pressure on businesses reliant on discretionary spending. The sell-off was largely driven by growing concerns over President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies, combined with economic uncertainties fuelled by potential government spending cuts and workforce reductions. Also Watch: In China, the Shanghai Composite declined by 0.4 per cent, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell by 0.9 per cent. Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sell-off, which resulted in a staggering $4 trillion loss in market value, has cast a shadow over the US economy and hastriggered fears of a recession. As the week progresses, market participants are closely watching whether lawmakers can pass a funding bill to prevent a partial government shutdown and how Trump\u2019s policies will evolve to stabilise the economy. Wall Street remains highly volatile, with many anticipating further declines if policy uncertainty persists. Goldman Sachs has now increased the probability of a recession within the next year to 20 per cent, citing the increasing uncertainty in fiscal and trade policy. Trump\u2019s administration has been pushing for a series of economic policies aimed at limiting government spending, cutting the federal workforce, and boosting domestic manufacturing. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond dropped to 4.22 per cent from 4.32 per cent within a day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a significant shift for the bond market. Additionally, bitcoin, once a symbol of unstoppable momentum, fell below $80,000 from its December high of $106,000.", "https://www.aol.com/finance/stretch-financial-wellness-150407266.html": "Choosing the right budgeting app starts with understanding your financial needs and habits. To determine if Stretch is a fit for you, consider these questions: Debt management focus: Unlike some general budgeting apps, Stretch provides specific tools for monitoring and reducing debt, including credit score visibility. Stretch Financial Wellness is an app designed to help users manage their finances with a focus on debt management, real-time insights and guidance for making financial progress. Stretch does have notable advantages, including its user-friendly interface, emphasis on progress over perfection and the ability to make payments directly through the app. Unlike some competitors, it offers a free version, albeit with significant limitations. Financial education: Learn what you need to know with easy-to-understand info designed to boost your financial confidence and knowledge. The competitive budgeting app landscape includes alternatives like You Need a Budget (YNAB) and PocketGuard, which offer similar benefits at comparable price points. Before committing, you can take advantage of Stretch\u2019s free trial period to determine if its features align with your financial management style. This hands-on experience will reveal whether the app\u2019s interface, notification system and debt-tracking capabilities provide genuine value for your situation. Stretch includes features for tracking debt, monitoring credit scores and creating payment plans that may help with credit card debt management. Though marketed as a comprehensive financial wellness tool, Stretch may not adequately serve those with complex financial situations due to its limited personalization and absence of human advisor support. Advertisement Categorized spending insights: The app organizes spending into categories to help users understand spending patterns and make adjustments. This financial literacy gap is reflected in Americans\u2019 saving habits. According to\u00a0Bankrate\u2019s 2024 Emergency Savings Report, 32 percent of consumers have less money in savings than they did a year ago, and 9 percent say they have no savings at all. The $12.99 monthly fee for the Vision subscription may be counterproductive for budget-conscious users, especially since the free version only supports one credit card. Considering the average American has 3.84 credit cards, many users would need to upgrade to the paid plan for full functionality. Financial marketplace: Users can explore financial products from selected institutions, including credit cards, loans, bank accounts and more. Customized goal setting: Define and track goals like saving for an emergency fund, staying within a budget or paying off debt. Can Stretch help pay off credit card debt? Stretch Financial Wellness (simply known as \u201cStretch\u201d) aims to take financial management further by focusing on where your money can take you rather than just showing how you spend it. Let\u2019s examine Stretch\u2019s features, benefits and limitations to help you determine if it\u2019s right for your financial goals. Reputable budgeting apps typically employ secure encryption and follow privacy standards to protect financial data. Before signing up for any financial service, verify its security features and privacy policy. Financial stress affects more than your bank account. According to the American Psychological Association, 63 percent of Americans cite money as a significant source of stress. This stress can impact mental health, daily functioning and even physical wellbeing. Are budgeting apps trustworthy? Real-time insights: Get up-to-date notifications on your spending and savings so you can adjust in the moment. The app provides tools to help users understand their financial situation, plan for the future and work toward personal financial goals. It approaches financial management by breaking down complex concepts into more manageable steps and providing actionable insights. Stretch aims to differentiate itself from standard budgeting apps by offering more comprehensive tools for financial management. While budgeting apps are plentiful, Stretch offers several useful features: Stretch offers a 7-day free trial, after which the Vision subscription costs $9.99 monthly for the first three months with promotional code SAVE3FOR3. Regular pricing is $12.99 monthly. Financial wellness extends beyond money management \u2014 it\u2019s about having the freedom to make choices that improve your quality of life without constant financial worry. Whether handling unexpected expenses or saving for long-term goals, financial wellness provides greater control over your money and increased peace of mind. But there\u2019s good news: Working toward financial goals, such as debt reduction or emergency fund building, typically correlates with increased confidence and security regardless of income level. Financial wellness creates stability that can improve overall quality of life. In these cases, you might be better served by financial planning software with more advanced features, consulting with a financial advisor, or using free spreadsheet templates designed for budgeting. For premium support please call: Have basic budgeting apps failed to give you the structure and motivation you need? Do you need guidance to develop better financial habits but don\u2019t want to hire a financial advisor? Centralized dashboard: The Vision subscription allows users to link banking accounts, credit cards and various debts including student loans, car loans and mortgages. In behavioral economics, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cnudging\u201d \u2014 small, thoughtful prompts that help us make better decisions without being intrusive. Budgeting apps often claim to be that nudge, but not all of them deliver. Some simply log your spending after the fact, while others try to guide you toward smarter money habits in real time. Would real-time spending insights and reminders help you make better financial decisions? In-app notifications: Through text or email, Stretch provides reminders about financial goals and payments. Is debt management (especially credit cards) a primary financial goal for you? Do you prefer having all your accounts \u2014 loans, credit cards and savings \u2014 visible in one dashboard? Does Stretch charge fees for its features? Users with debt from smaller lenders using less advanced technology may find that Stretch doesn\u2019t fully integrate with these institutions. Similarly, those managing finances across multiple countries will likely find the app insufficient for their needs, as Stretch isn\u2019t designed to handle international financial complexities. If you\u2019re particularly focused on debt management and benefit from real-time feedback, Stretch\u2019s comprehensive dashboard might justify its $12.99 monthly subscription cost. The app can serve as a middle ground between basic free budgeting tools and more expensive financial advisory services. If you answered yes to most of these questions, Stretch could be beneficial. However, consider alternative solutions if you have complex financial circumstances requiring personalized advice, manage finances across international borders, are already comfortable using spreadsheets or other low-cost alternatives, or find that the subscription cost doesn\u2019t fit your budget. Stretch offers these key features: That said, Stretch isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution for financial planning or budgeting. While it offers helpful features, there are some limitations to consider. The 2024 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index shows that financial literacy in the U.S. has remained at about 50 percent for eight years, with a 2 percent decline in the past two years. This knowledge gap often leads to financial decisions that can make progress difficult.", "https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-recession-risk-provides-tinder-smoldering-market-volatility-2025-03-10/": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://fortune.com/2025/03/11/goldman-sachs-chief-economist-downgrades-entire-us-economy-trump-tariffs-markets/": "\u00a9 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

China's CSI 300 was 0.1% higher. Trump has downplayed the economic fallout from tariffs, saying the US economy will head into a \"period of transition\" and adjustment. During a Sunday interview, he also did not rule out a recession, spooking markets. \"In the case of a US recession and large-scale wealth destruction, and because of the sharp rise in foreign sovereign bond yields, there seems scope for de-risking of USD assets,\" they wrote. The sell-off in US stock markets fueled by fears of a recession could prompt investors to put their money elsewhere, changing up global financial flows. Indices Some foreign investors may repatriate their money home. In time, a new global reserve currency could emerge alongside the dollar. On Tuesday, Asian shares opened lower but pared losses over the trading day. \"After all there remains no meaningful alternative to the USD as the world's reserve currency, wrote the Nomura analysts. \"It would have sounded fanciful only a month ago, but after Europe's fiscal paradigm shift, perhaps it could be the euro,\" Nomura analysts wrote. Commodities On Sunday, Goldman Sachs said some investors are considering entering China's stock markets again as equities in the world's second-largest economy stage a resurgence following the boost from the DeepSeek hype. Foreign investors \u2014 who hold $17.6 trillion worth of US equities \u2014 could be tempted to pull some of their money from the US. However, this may not be the case if a recession occurs. If the US economy slows but doesn't slip into a recession, foreign investors may reallocate their holdings from US equities to US debt, wrote Nomura. As Trump's America First policy reverberates across the world, major economies \u2014 including Europe and China \u2014 are ramping up policy stimulus to boost growth. Their moves could make these markets more attractive for investors. Stocks Monday's selloff comes as investors are already weighing massive changes in the US that have heightened policy uncertainty, including tariffs, deportations, and massive DOGE job cuts. These changes could undermine economic risk growth and increase recession risk, in turn hitting the $60 trillion US stock market. \"Our latest investor conversations suggest that global LO mandates have become more engaged in Chinese capital market transactions (IPOs and placements) of late, and are increasingly motivated to add to the public market given the recent weakness and volatility in the US stock market where their allocations are close to all-time highs,\" wrote Goldman Sachs' analysts, referring to long-only mandates from mutual funds. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.6% lower while South Korea's Kospi ended 1.3% down. Currencies Investors are so rattled that the S&P 500 has lost 4.5% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down 9.5% \u2014 bucking bullish calls earlier this year. The change in tune comes on the back of a bull run in China's stock markets. The MSCI China Index is up 18% so far this year, marking an exceptionally strong showing Chinese stocks after several years of dismal performance.", "https://www.etfdailynews.com/2025/03/11/vanguard-russell-2000-etf-nasdaqvtwo-shares-sold-by-us-bancorp-de/": " The Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (VTWO) is an exchange-traded fund that is based on the Russell 2000 index, a market-cap-weighted index of US small-cap stocks VTWO was launched on Sep 20, 2010 and is managed by Vanguard.

The consumer watchdog agency that has been largely shuttered by the Trump administration had asked a federal court earlier this month to pause its enforcement action against the bank. It is one of several high-profile lawsuits the agency has moved to either scrap or pause under new leadership.

That will a fall of about 7 to 9 per cent from current levels. BACK TO TOP The S&P 500 (5,615) had failed in its several attempts to breach the psychological 6,000 mark since December last year. The strong fall since last week confirms that a top is in place. S&P 500 index can fall to 5,450, another 3 per cent fall from here. A bounce thereafter can take the index up to 5,600 or even higher. India\u2019s Sensex (73,950, down 0.2 per cent) and Nifty 50 (22,436, down 0.1 per cent) seem to be managing to stay afloat under this circumstance.

On the charts, the picture is very weak for the US markets, especially for the Dow Jones and the S&P 500.

Because, there has been a divergence between the Indian and the US benchmark indices for some time. Sensex and Nifty 50 have been coming down since October last year. The US markets on the other hand continued to sustain higher and started to fall fromFebruary this year. So, the  Indian markets can remain at lower levels, but stable and may be in a range for some time when the US markets continue to fall. We will have to wait and watch. +\u00a05.05 +\u00a011.00 The above analysis indicates that the US markets are likely to get beaten down more. So, that in turn can keep the global equity markets under pressure. So, will the Sensex and Nifty 50 fall more along with the US markets? Could be yes. But there are chances to see a slow pace of fall in our markets from current levels. Intermediate support is at 41,300 from where a short-lived corrective bounce is possible. Get businessline apps on Connect with us Immediate support is 16,900. Below that 16,340 \u2013 the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement level, is the next important support. The downside is limited to either 16,900 itself or 16,340. That will be about 3 to 6 per cent from the current levels. TO ENJOY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 (36,552) is down 1.3 per cent, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng (23,562) is down 0.93 per cent and China\u2019s Shanghai Composite (3,350) index is down about 0.5 per cent. The price action in the Dow Jones (41,911.71) since November last year indicates a clear double-top formation on the chart. This is a reversal pattern. \u00a0The neckline of this pattern is at 42,050 which is just been broken on Monday. So, a further fall from here will confirm this pattern. It will be very bearish for the Dow and can intensify the sell-off. Get BusinessLine apps on In that case, there is a danger of the Dow Jones tumbling to 40,000 and even 39,000-38,850 in the coming months.

It\u2019s already intense as evidenced by the presence of Visa, American Express, Discover, Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, ApplePay, and various crypto entrants too numerous to list. The cost of financial transactions is headed to zero. Whether credit cards, debit cards, person-to-person, crypto, and surely beyond, the costs are poised to fall. ByJohn Tamny An illustration photo shows a display of credit cards on September 12, 2023 in Los Angeles, ... [+] California. Credit card debt from US consumers is rising by billions of dollars amid higher inflation and interest rates, topping $1 trillion for the first time in history, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP) (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) Notable about Visa\u2019s achievements is that they took place in the face of other legislation, including the Durbin Amendment, which among other things price-controlled swipe fees on debit cards to the detriment of users. Yet even with the barriers erected, Visa succeeded in making debit cards the primary way that individuals interact with their hard-earned money. What\u2019s important about all this is that Visa is not done innovating. Evidence supporting this claim can be found in the previously-mentioned truth that victors in any sector are invariably the ones most successful when it comes to driving down prices. All of which explains why it\u2019s necessary for the Trump administration to quickly reverse the Biden administration\u2019s errors. Competition is already fierce, and Visa is one of the best competitors. Rather than saddle it with government harassment, let\u2019s get government out of the way so that Visa can try its hand at inventing a payments future that will vastly improve on the present. In short, Trump should call off the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit precisely because he aims to bring down transaction costs for consumers as quickly as possible. Exactly because production is exploding globally, so are efforts by a myriad of entities to facilitate all this exchange. Despite this, the DOJ is presently attacking Visa for succeeding in a space (debit) that is already defined by enormous competition, and that will include quite a bit more in the near and long term. Which means Visa\u2019s success in debit isn\u2019t anti-competitive as the DOJ contends, rather it\u2019s a powerful signal that it uniquely anticipated a growing market for lower-cost card payments. Despite this, Zelle recently found itself under attack from the mis-named Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), credit and debt card issuers have endured all manner of federal attempts to price control swipe fees, not to mention that Visa is presently the target of a Department of Justice antitrust suit related to debit cards. It\u2019s time to reverse these superfluous encroachments. Even better, President Trump should thrill at doing this exactly because it would involve undoing errors made on the watch of his predecessor, Joe Biden. The good news is that the Trump administration has already gotten started. Even though Zelle was created to make payments and cash exchanges much safer from fraud and abuse, the CFPB made it its aim during Biden\u2019s presidency to saddle banks with the cost of any fraud or theft that took place with the payments system. Thankfully the Trump administration has already rolled back the CFPB\u2019s actions. And while there\u2019s much more to do, the next step should be for it to call off the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) antitrust suit against Visa. Which is why it\u2019s essential that the Trump administration call off the regulatory and antitrust watchdogs presently gnashing their teeth at the businesses trying to invent the future of payments. The above prediction is rendered a certainty by the happy truth that the most highly valued U.S. corporations are invariably the ones that provide the most for the least.

Dubbed the QX65, Infiniti confirmed the new model in late 2023 with an official teaser image. Expected to arrive in late 2024 or early 2025, the QX65 will likely debut as a 2026 model for the U.S. market. It will serve as a sportier, two-row alternative to the QX60 midsize SUV, with which it shares its underpinnings. I agree to receive emails from Motor Authority. I understand that I can unsubscribe at any time. Privacy Policy. Inside, the QX65 is expected to share much of its cabin design with the QX60, meaning a decent level of standard equipment including a 12.3-inch infotainment display and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Details on the QX65\u2019s powertrain remain unconfirmed, but there are a couple of likely options. The 2025 QX60 recently dropped the standard 3.5-liter V-6 in favor of a 2.0-liter turbo-4 producing 268 hp, paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission that allows for 6,000 pounds of towing capacity. It\u2019s possible Infiniti will use this powertain in the QX65, though a more exciting option would be the 450-hp twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 found in the QX80, giving the QX65 the performance to match its sporty styling. While the QX60 comes standard with front-wheel drive, the QX65 may lean into its performance-oriented nature by offering all-wheel drive as standard. Infiniti also offers a smaller QX55 coupe-like crossover related to the QX50 compact crossover. However, both models are reportedly getting dropped after the 2025 model year. Spy shots of the QX65 prototype show it testing alongside an updated QX60, suggesting both models may debut around the same time. The QX65 will adopt Infiniti\u2019s latest design language, first seen on the 2025 QX80, including split headlights featuring the brand\u2019s signature Piano Key daytime running lights and a bold grille with vertical slats inspired by a bamboo forest. A sculpted Infiniti logo will sit prominently atop the grille. At the rear, the fastback roofline evokes the spirit of the Infiniti FX, the brand\u2019s pioneering coupe-style SUV from the 2000s. A full-width taillight strip further enhances the modern aesthetic. 2026 Infiniti QX65 spy shots - Photo via Baldauf With its limited lineup Infiniti is in dire need of new products, but some relief is coming soon. Following the introduction of the redesigned 2025 Infiniti QX80 full-size SUV last year, the next major addition to the lineup will be a new coupe-like SUV, which was recently spotted in prototype form.", "https://chicago.suntimes.com/nation-world/2025/03/10/dow-drops-wall-street-economy": "Asked over the weekend whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News Channel: \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d He then added, \u201cIt takes a little time. It takes a little time.\u201d Seth Wenig/Associated Press The economy has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism. And a widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the U.S. economy may already be shrinking. At Goldman Sachs, for example, David Mericle cut his estimate for U.S. economic growth to 1.7% from 2.2% for the end of 2025 over the year before, largely because tariffs look like they\u2019ll be bigger than he was previously forecasting. The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled again to 4.22% from 4.32% late Friday. It\u2019s been dropping since January, when it was approaching 4.80%, as worries about the economy have grown. That\u2019s a major move for the bond market. It\u2019s not just stocks struggling. Investors are sending prices lower for all kinds of investments whose momentum had earlier seemed nearly impossible to stop at times, such as bitcoin. The cryptocurrency\u2019s value has dropped below $80,000 from more than $106,000 in December. Search The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% to drag it close to 9% below its all-time high, which was set just last month. At one point, the S&P 500 was down 3.6% and on track for its worst day since 2022. That\u2019s when the highest inflation in generations was shredding budgets and raising worries about a possible recession that ultimately never came. Financial news reports play as people work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. ServiceNow fell 7.9% after the AI platform company said it was buying AI-assistant maker Moveworks for $2.85 billion in cash and stock. Terms of Use \u2022 Privacy Notice \u2022 Cookie Policy \u2022 Terms of Sale Stocks of companies that depend on U.S. households feeling good enough about their finances to spend also fell sharply. Cruise-ship operator Carnival dropped 7.6%, and United Airlines lost 6.3%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 155.64 points to 5,614.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 890.01 to 41,911.71, and the Nasdaq composite sank 727.90 to 17,468.32. \u00a9 2025 Chicago Sun-Times Media, Inc.

Alvarez/Associated Press In stock markets abroad, European indexes largely fell following a mixed session in Asia. Instead, investors have bid up U.S. Treasury bonds as they look for things whose prices can hold up better when the economy is under pressure. That has sent prices for Treasurys sharply higher, which in turn has sent down their yields. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 890 points, or 2.1%, after paring an earlier loss of more than 1,100, while the Nasdaq composite skidded by 4%. Nvidia fell another 5.1% Monday to bring its loss for the year so far to more than 20%. It\u2019s a steep drop-off from its nearly 820% surge over 2023 and 2024. Indexes fell 1.8% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai after China said consumer prices fell in February for the first time in 13 months. It\u2019s the latest signal of weakness for the world\u2019s second-largest economy, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday. President Donald Trump exits Air Force One Sunday after arriving at Joint Base Andrews, Md. Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla fell 15.4% to deepen its loss for 2025 to 45%. After getting an initial post-election bump on hopes that Musk\u2019s close relationship with Trump would help the electric-vehicle company, the stock has slumped on worries that its brand has become intertwined with Musk. Protests against the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to cull its workforce and other moves have targeted Tesla dealerships, for example. Share \u201cThere are always multiple forces at work in the market, but right now, almost all of them are taking a back seat to tariffs,\u201d according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. All the uncertainty, though, hasn\u2019t shut down dealmaking on Wall Street. Redfin\u2019s stock jumped 67.9% after Rocket said it would buy the digital real estate brokerage in an all-stock deal valuing it at $1.75 billion. Rocket\u2019s stock sank 15.3%. It was the worst day yet in a scary stretch where the S&P 500 has swung more than 1%, up or down, seven times in eight days because of Trump\u2019s on -and- off -again tariffs. The worry is that the whipsaw moves will either hurt the economy directly or create enough uncertainty to drive U.S. companies and consumers into an economy-freezing paralysis. The U.S. job market is still showing stable hiring at the moment, to be sure, and the economy ended last year running at a solid rate. But economists are marking down their forecasts for how the economy will perform this year. Trump met on Monday with tech industry CEOs, but the event was closed to the news media. He remained silent about the sell-off through the day. NEW YORK \u2014 The U.S. stock market\u2019s sell-off cut deeper on Monday as Wall Street questioned how much pain President Donald Trump will let the economy endure through tariffs and other policies in order to get what he wants. Trump says he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, among other reasons he\u2019s given for tariffs. His Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has also said the economy may go through a \u201cdetox\u201d period as it weans off an addiction to spending by the government. The White House is trying to limit federal spending, while also cutting the federal workforce and increasing deportations, which could hinder the job market.", "https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/trade-ideas/hedging-against-bear-market-crash-these-etfs-could-get-job-done": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-03112025-11694543": "Teradyne shares, which entered Tuesday little changed over the past year, were down 18% in recent trading, at their lowest level in more than a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average\u00a0and S&P 500\u00a0were down 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively, in recent trading, while the tech-heavy\u00a0Nasdaq was down 0.3%. Stocks kicked off the week with sharp losses after big declines last week, as investors have grown increasingly concerned about the potential impact of policies coming from the Trump White House and the possibility that the economy could slip into a recession. Kohl's\u00a0missed estimates last quarter, when its said craft store chain Michaels Cos. CEO Ashley Buchanan would be replacing Tom Kingsbury as chief executive. In a presentation ahead of its Investor Day, the company said that it sees short-term volatility \"mainly in SemiTest business,\" as well as new uncertainty around tariffs and trade restrictions. It added it doesn\u2019t expect cancellations, \"but some push outs and capital reviews.\" Despite the lowered guidance, shares of Southwest jumped 9% as the airline also announced it would end a longstanding policy of not charging fees on checked bags. Investors should monitor key support levels on Tesla's chart around $215 and $165, while also watching major resistance levels near $265 and $300. S&P 500 futures rose 0.5%. Bitcoin was at $80,700 in recent trading, down from an earlier high of $82,100 but up from an overnight low of $76,600. The digital currency has been trading at its lowest levels since November. The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which has slumped in recent weeks as the concerns about the health of the economy have mounted, was at 4.24% recently, up from 4.21% at yesterday's close. The economic data calendar is light today, but investors will be paying close attention to the consumer price index report that is due to be released tomorrow morning. The Nasdaq Composite's 4% decline yesterday marked its biggest one-day drop since 2022, while the S&P 500 and Dow both had their worst days since December. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are at their lowest levels since September, as major indexes have wiped away all the gains that led to a series of record highs after the presidential election. Kohl's shares were down 15% in recent trading and have lost more than 60% of their value over the past year. The stock dipped below $10 for the first time since 1997 this morning. Analytics software provider Palantir (PLTR) and advertising platform AppLovin (APP), two AI investor favorites that have been hit hard recently, were up nearly 3% and 5%, respectively. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) rose more than 6%. Major Stock Index Futures Point to Higher Open Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.6%. Tesla shares fell below the closely watched 200-week moving average in Monday\u2019s trading session. Moreover, increasing\u00a0volumes\u00a0have accompanied the recent drop, signaling selling participation by larger market players, such as\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0and hedge funds. -Aaron McDade On Tuesday, Trump said on his Truth Social platform that tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Canada would be 50% starting Wednesday, up from the 25% rates that were due to go into effect. Trump said the decision was retaliation for Ontario's decision to impose a 25% tariff on electricity exports from the province to the U.S. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.4%. Shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA), which fell 15% yesterday to lead the tech sector rout, were up 3.5% in recent trading. The stock has fallen more than 50% from its mid-December record high amid investor concerns about how CEO Elon Musk's heavy involvement in the Trump administration could affect the company's brand image and sales. Southwest shares were up more than 6% in recent trading. Despite Tuesday's gains, they've lost about 10% of their value since the start of the year. The changes follow\u00a0months of disputes\u00a0with Elliott, which\u00a0built a stake\u00a0in Southwest last year and\u00a0pushed for changes\u00a0at the executive\u00a0and board level. In October, the sides\u00a0agreed to a settlement\u00a0that saw five Elliott-backed candidates added to Southwest's board. Also on Tuesday, Southwest lowered its projected growth for first-quarter revenue per available seat mile to\u00a0a year-over-year increase of 2% to 4%, from 5% to 7% previously. -Timothy Smith Tesla (TSLA) shares moved slightly higher in premarket trading after tumbling 15% on Monday to lead S&P decliners, closing below their Election Day level for the first time. Shares of automakers lost ground on the news, with General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) were down 2.5% and 4%, respectively, while Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLA) dropped 4.5%. Investors fear that Trump's wide-ranging efforts to impose tariffs will harm companies that source parts and products from other countries and that do business around the world, especially as other countries introduce retaliatory measures. The trade levies, economists say, are also likely to spur inflation and cause economic growth to slow. Gold futures were up 0.9% at $2,925 an ounce, while West Texas intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, rose 1% to $66.70 per barrel. Tesla Prices to Watch After Stock's 50% Decline from Record While the\u00a0relative strength index confirms bearish momentum with a reading below 50, the indicator has moved into a region that has typically corresponded with bounces in the stock stretching back to May 2022. Shares of Verizon (VZ) were down 7%, leading Dow decliners this morning, after the telecommunications giant warned of weak subscriber growth. Kohl's Stock Plunges on Disappointing Outlook Shares of Teradyne (TER) plummeted to lead\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0decliners Tuesday, as the maker of testing equipment for chips and electronics updated its guidance in response to the potential impact of Trump administration trade moves. The introduction of baggage fees are the newest change for Southwest, which in July\u00a0announced an end\u00a0to its famed open seating policy and introduced overnight flights, which started last month. The airline has since said it plans to start booking assigned seating flights in the second half of this year and roll out the changes in 2026. Other mega-cap tech stocks were mixed. Apple (AAPL) shares were down more than 3%, while Google-parent Alphabet\u00a0(GOOG) fell 1.5% and Microsoft (MSFT) was down slightly. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was up 1.5%, while rival Broadcom (AVGO) added 3%, and Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META)\u00a0also gained ground. Comparable store sales fell by 6.7%, a bit better than the 6.9% decline that analysts had projected. In addition to the update, Teradyne also announced it bought privately held Quantifi Photonics for an undisclosed price. Quantifi manufactures photonic integrated circuit testing devices. The department store chain's fiscal fourth-quarter results were mixed, with\u00a0profits\u00a0lagging analysts' projections. It posted EPS of $0.43 on net revenue of $5.4 billion. (After adjusting for one-time costs like store closures, Kohl's adjusted EPS of $0.95 topped estimates.) Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $0.71 and $5.38 billion, respectively. Last year, Kohl's registered profit of $1.67 per share and sales of $5.96 billion. Southwest Jumps After News of Baggage Fees Airline stocks were down after Delta (DAL), American (AAL) and Southwest (LUV), all lowered their outlooks. Delta, which cut its sales and profit guidance\u00a0for the first quarter, citing economic \"uncertainty\" that has hit travel demand, was off more than 8%. Shares of American fell nearly 6%, while United Airlines (UAL) dropped 3%. Shares of Kohl's (KSS) plunged in early trading after the struggling retailer's forecasts fell short of analysts' expectations. TradingView The stock was up 0.4% at $223 in recent premarket trading. Since hitting a record high in mid-December, Tesla shares have fallen 55% amid investor concerns about potential fallout from Musk's extensive involvement in the Trump administration and weak sales figures. Michael Nagle / Bloomberg / Getty Images The airline said it would introduce a basic economy ticket option and baggage fees, ending some of Southwest's\u00a0trademark perks. Certain members of the airline's rewards program will still be eligible for one or two free checked bags once the policy changes for flights booked on or after May 28. For fiscal 2025, Kohl's projects net sales to fall 5% to 7%, comparable sales to fall 4% to 6%, and\u00a0earnings per share (EPS)\u00a0of between $0.10 and $0.60. Analysts were looking for 2025 net sales to decline by about 2%, comparable sales to decline by 1.83%, and EPS of $1.26, according to Visible Alpha data. Read the full technical analysis piece here. Southwest Airlines (LUV) shares surged Tuesday after the airline announced its latest revenue-generating changes amid pressure from\u00a0activist investor\u00a0Elliott Investment Management. Stocks were lower in early-afternoon trading Tuesday after the Trump administration unveiled higher tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, as concerns about political and economic uncertainty continue to spark market volatility. Teradyne didn't forecast any changes to its outlook for the current quarter\u00a0but anticipates second-quarter revenue to be flat to down 10% from the first quarter and full-year revenue up 5% to 10% year-over-year.

Economists have also lowered their GDP forecasts. In fact, Morgan Stanley economist Michael Gapen revised his economic outlook from \u201cslower growth, stickier inflation\u201d to a more pessimistic \u201cslower growth, firmer inflation.\u201d This change in outlook has led Gapen to lower his full-year GDP growth forecast from 1.9% to 1.5%. Commodities The S&P 500 (SPX) continues to slide as Wall Street experts increasingly warn about the potential for an economic downturn, with some even mentioning the possibility of stagflation. For context, stagflation is a scenario where economic growth falls, but inflation remains high and unemployment rates rise. Historically, the S&P 500 has performed poorly during stagflationary periods, with an annualized decline of 10%. Indices Overall, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\u00a0(SPY)\u00a0based on 415 Buys, 84 Holds, and six Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a\u00a013% rally in its share price\u00a0over the past year, the\u00a0average SPY price target\u00a0of $690.21 per share implies 23.1% upside potential. Stocks This worry has grown as investors try to understand the impact of Trump\u2019s continuously changing trade policies and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Indeed, the possibility of stagflation has increased recently, according to Evercore ISI\u2019s Julian Emanuel, who noted that tariff policies and Musk\u2019s DOGE efforts could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.

However, some of the internal indicators pointed to an even greater softening in sentiment. Coinbase jumped 6% Tuesday after falling to its worst level since July 2022 a day earlier.

What's more, the analyst said the company's diversification with M&A can help insulate the business and keep margins stable. Kohl's\u00a0\u2014 Shares of the retailer sank 14% after\u00a0fourth-quarter results\u00a0showed a decline of 9.4% in net sales and full year guidance missed expectations. Kohl's said it expects earnings per share of between 10 cents and 60 cents for the current fiscal year, below the $1.23 expected by analysts, according to LSEG.

Wolfe Research turned bullish on Madison Square Garden Entertainment, saying the stock is pricing in an unlikely stagnation in the entertainment business. \u2014 Jeff Cox Shares were down slightly in the premarket despite the announcement. \"It's become a super cyclical asset \u2014 the first to drop with every bad news [event] as a convenient store of cash, but also the first to recover,\" he added. \"This further underlines why its use as a reserve is questionable but shows it's getting more and more FX-like in its action, so adoption is spreading. \u00a0It would make sense to expect more volatility over the coming months as the world's trade priorities change.\" Tickers that hit this milestone included: \u2014 Leslie Josephs The majority of the stocks in the S&P 500 are already in correction territory as the sell-off on Wall Street continues to drag the benchmark closer to that key threshold.

The\u00a02-year Treasury\u00a0yield\u00a0dropped as low as 3.829% before recovering slightly to around 3.875%. 203 companies, or 41% of the S&P 500, closed more than 20% below their 52-week highs. The pullback led Citigroup to lower its rating on U.S. stocks to neutral from overweight, pointing to a \"pause in U.S. exceptionalism\" as the reason. Adding to worries around the economy was the latest guidance from Delta Air Lines. The company slashed its earnings outlook due to weaker U.S. demand, pushing the stock down more than 8%. Stocks kicked off Tuesday's session in the red, extending their losses from Monday's sell-off. The stock's outperformance came after Trump posted on Tuesday morning that he planned to purchase a Tesla and blasted a boycott of the brand. Tesla has been under scrutiny as CEO Elon Musk has opined on international politics and was notably tapped to lead Trump's controversial government cost-cutting initiative. \u2014 Sean Conlon In a Truth Social post, Trump said steel and aluminum duties would double to 50% from 25%, effective Wednesday.

The\u00a0SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT)\u00a0was last trading 2.1% lower on Tuesday and pacing for back-to-back losses. Shares of the electric vehicle maker rose more than 1% shortly before 11 a.m. ET, on track to snap a three-day losing streak. By comparison, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, meanwhile, told clients on Monday that they should buy into Tesla after the stock's steep decline. Shares have plunged about 45% this year, including a slide of more than 15% seen in Monday's session that marked its worst day since 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday after President Donald Trump placed additional tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum coming into the U.S. \u2014 Scott Schnipper On Tuesday, 14 stocks in the S&P 500 were trading at new 52-week lows. Supino noted that Madison Square Garden's events for the first quarter of 2026 are trending above the record set in the same three-month period a year prior, which he said offers a \"positive early signal\" for the fiscal year.

U.S. Treasury yields continued to slide on Tuesday as fears of a possible U.S. recession pushed investors to safe havens. On the other hand, just four stocks in the index hit new 52-week highs: CME Group, Bristol-Myers, Cencora and CenterPoint Energy. \"We continue to believe that the U.S. economy is still solid, on the back of the high-end consumer, which drives roughly 50% of overall spending,\" he wrote. \"While we see the current market action as a 'typical' drawdown for stocks with NDX and SPX down 10% & 7% from highs, technical measures are signaling fear but not a washout.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 77 points, or 0.2%. The S&P 500 also slid 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite edged 0.1% lower. One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions. Among them: A net 37% of small biz owners expect the economy to improve, down 10 percentage points from January; just 12% said now is a good time to expand, a decrease of 5 points and the biggest monthly drop since April 2020; and a net 32% say they are raising prices, up 10 points for largest monthly increase since April 2021 and the third-highest reading ever. \"There's clearly a tolerance for pain on the part of the administration in pursuit of trade goals that are not necessarily entirely economic in nature,\" said Ross Mayfield, Baird investment strategist. \"At this point I'm still in the camp that we're not on the doorstep of a recession, but maybe a slowdown or growth scare. Non-recession sell-offs tend to be shorter and milder than the recessionary ones.\" Brown's call comes amid a rough patch for the stock, which has dropped just over 11% in 2025. Southwest Airlines announced Tuesday that, for the first time, it will charge passengers to check bags. The move comes as the low-cost airline tries to boost revenue while coming under pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management. \"Given our expectations for a choppy Spring selling season and growing risks to gross margin due to the challenging macro environment and uncertainty around the MRP spin-off, we believe a more cautious stance is warranted,\" Rahmani wrote in a note to clients. \u2014 Katrina Bishop As of Monday's close, 366 S&P 500 components or 73% were trading 10% or more below their respective 52-week highs, which means they have already suffered a correction. A total of 203 components closed more than 20% below 52-week highs\u00a0as of Monday, meaning they are in bear market territory. He also lowered his price target to $141 from $152, which implies 13% upside from Monday's close. Shares are down 8% year to date.

Brown cut $1 off his price target to $179, but that still implies 15.9% upside over Monday's close. Crypto stocks bounced after suffering steep declines on Monday.

Howard also pointed to the company's unique global exposure, which she said provides a runway in markets like China and India.

Small business sentiment declined in February as owners began raising prices and grew more uncertain about future conditions. \"[Bitcoin] is a short term, liquid store of capital and an asset that can easily be temporarily liquidated to draw cash to cover collateral needs,\" said James Davies, CEO at trading platform Crypto Valley Exchange. \"Once other assets that are more impacted are liquidated, the bitcoin trade gets its liquidity back.\" The New York Stock Exchange fared a little better, with 76.38% of total volume declining and 22.75% advancing.

The benchmark\u00a010-year Treasury yield\u00a0fell as much as 5 basis points to hit 4.162% earlier in the morning before paring some losses to trade around 4.1865% at around midday Singapore time (12:05 a.m. ET). Also as of Monday, five out of the 11 GICS sectors were trading 10% or more off of their 52-week high close. These five sectors included consumer discretionary, technology, communication services, materials and energy. \u2014 Jesse Pound \"We believe that MDLZ has significant upside from here,\" Howard wrote to clients. That's \"based on the likely eventual deflation in cocoa costs, which have already started to fall from recent peaks but have yet to stabilize.\" Analyst Michael Brown upgraded the investment bank's stock to overweight from underweight. Brown cut $1 off his price target to $179, but that still implies 15.9% upside over Monday's close. Crypto stocks bounced after suffering steep declines on Monday.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods is moving to the sidelines on Lennar, downgrading the stock to market perform from outperform Monday. Howard also pointed to the company's unique global exposure, which she said provides a runway in markets like China and India.

Small business sentiment declined in February as owners began raising prices and grew more uncertain about future conditions. \"[Bitcoin] is a short term, liquid store of capital and an asset that can easily be temporarily liquidated to draw cash to cover collateral needs,\" said James Davies, CEO at trading platform Crypto Valley Exchange. \"Once other assets that are more impacted are liquidated, the bitcoin trade gets its liquidity back.\" The New York Stock Exchange fared a little better, with 76.38% of total volume declining and 22.75% advancing.

As of Monday's close, 366 components of the S&P 500 \u2014 or roughly 73% of the benchmark \u2014 were trading 10% or more below their 52-week highs. \u2014 Gina Francolla, Lisa Kailai Han Those numbers correspond roughly with the number of declining versus advancing stocks. On both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, decliners beat advancers by about 4 to 1. New 52-week lows on Nasdaq reached 413 against just 69 new highs, while on the NYSE new lows beat new highs 137 to 42.

However, some of the internal indicators pointed to an even greater softening in sentiment. Coinbase jumped 6% Tuesday after falling to its worst level since July 2022 a day earlier. Robinhood gained 5% after it also fell to a 2022 low. Bitcoin miners broadly were higher, led by Core Scientific with a 6% gain. \"Investors are likely feeling 'tariff fatigue' as flip flopping of policy and a barrage of news flow throughout last week has whipsawed markets. While this week could very likely bring about more changes to 'current' policy, it remains certain that volatility and choppy trading will continue to dominate,\" wrote Chris Senyek, the firm's chief investment strategist. \u2014 Tanaya Macheel In other words, Brown said the stock's valuation is still considered lofty, but its \"all-weather\" business model shines during bouts of rocky markets. What's more, the analyst said the company's diversification with M&A can help insulate the business and keep margins stable. Kohl's\u00a0\u2014 Shares of the retailer sank 14% after\u00a0fourth-quarter results\u00a0showed a decline of 9.4% in net sales and full year guidance missed expectations. Kohl's said it expects earnings per share of between 10 cents and 60 cents for the current fiscal year, below the $1.23 expected by analysts, according to LSEG. U.S. stock futures were relatively unchanged Monday night following a broad market sell-off during the day's regular session. Tuesday's call marks a turn for Supino, who downgraded shares to peer perform after the stock was separated from Sphere Entertainment. While Supino said a consumer recession is a risk for share prices, the analyst said to see any cyclical pullbacks as temporary. Kohl's was the biggest laggard in the group and hit its lowest level since January 1997. Shares plunged 22% after the retailer issued disappointing guidance for 2025. Wolfe Research turned bullish on Madison Square Garden Entertainment, saying the stock is pricing in an unlikely stagnation in the entertainment business. \u2014 Jeff Cox Shares were down slightly in the premarket despite the announcement. \"It's become a super cyclical asset \u2014 the first to drop with every bad news [event] as a convenient store of cash, but also the first to recover,\" he added. \"This further underlines why its use as a reserve is questionable but shows it's getting more and more FX-like in its action, so adoption is spreading. \u00a0It would make sense to expect more volatility over the coming months as the world's trade priorities change.\" Tickers that hit this milestone included: \u2014 Leslie Josephs The majority of the stocks in the S&P 500 are already in correction territory as the sell-off on Wall Street continues to drag the benchmark closer to that key threshold. Here's a look at some notable movers in premarket trading. More than four out of five, or 82.27%, of all shares traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Monday fell in price, while only 17.21% advanced, according to FactSet data. The rest were unchanged. The\u00a02-year Treasury\u00a0yield\u00a0dropped as low as 3.829% before recovering slightly to around 3.875%. Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are 203 companies, or 41% of the S&P 500, closed more than 20% below their 52-week highs. The pullback led Citigroup to lower its rating on U.S. stocks to neutral from overweight, pointing to a \"pause in U.S. exceptionalism\" as the reason. Adding to worries around the economy was the latest guidance from Delta Air Lines. The company slashed its earnings outlook due to weaker U.S. demand, pushing the stock down more than 8%. Stocks kicked off Tuesday's session in the red, extending their losses from Monday's sell-off. The stock's outperformance came after Trump posted on Tuesday morning that he planned to purchase a Tesla and blasted a boycott of the brand. Tesla has been under scrutiny as CEO Elon Musk has opined on international politics and was notably tapped to lead Trump's controversial government cost-cutting initiative. \u2014 Sean Conlon In a Truth Social post, Trump said steel and aluminum duties would double to 50% from 25%, effective Wednesday. This is the latest in a series of escalating trade policy moves that have stoked fears of a U.S. economic recession. The White House has placed tariffs on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese imports, leading to steep losses in equities. Shares popped 1.6% before the bell on Tuesday. However, shares have tumbled around 14% in 2025. Wells Fargo issued a rare double-upgrade, calling Houlihan Lokey the right stock to play during the ongoing market volatility. On Monday, the Nasdaq saw its worst day since September 2022, dropping 4%. The 30-stock Dow, which lost nearly 900 points, closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 1, 2023. Shares of Revolve Group, Foot Locker and American Eagle Outfitters were all trading more than 5% lower. \u2014 Nick Wells, Lisa Kailai Han \u2014 Yun Li Southwest Airlines\u00a0\u2014 Shares of the budget airline jumped almost 10% after the company announced that it will start\u00a0charging passengers\u00a0to check bags and will begin offering a basic economy fare. The\u00a0SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT)\u00a0was last trading 2.1% lower on Tuesday and pacing for back-to-back losses. Shares of the electric vehicle maker rose more than 1% shortly before 11 a.m. ET, on track to snap a three-day losing streak. By comparison, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, meanwhile, told clients on Monday that they should buy into Tesla after the stock's steep decline. Shares have plunged about 45% this year, including a slide of more than 15% seen in Monday's session that marked its worst day since 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday after President Donald Trump placed additional tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum coming into the U.S. \u2014 Scott Schnipper On Tuesday, 14 stocks in the S&P 500 were trading at new 52-week lows. Supino noted that Madison Square Garden's events for the first quarter of 2026 are trending above the record set in the same three-month period a year prior, which he said offers a \"positive early signal\" for the fiscal year. A potential renovation of Penn Station would be a \"windfall,\" he added. While job losses from Elon Musk's new Department of Government Efficiency may have sent shockwaves through the market, these mass losses are unlikely to make a huge difference in any upcoming monetary policy decisions, according to Barclays. Also, the survey's Uncertainty Index increased to 104, a rise of 4 points and the second-highest reading in the survey's history, which dates to 1973. When asked about the possibility of a recession, Trump said during a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday that the economy was going through \"a period of transition.\" The remarks arrived after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Friday that there could be a \"detox period\" for the economy as the Trump administration slashes federal spending. U.S. Treasury yields continued to slide on Tuesday as fears of a possible U.S. recession pushed investors to safe havens. On the other hand, just four stocks in the index hit new 52-week highs: CME Group, Bristol-Myers, Cencora and CenterPoint Energy. \"We continue to believe that the U.S. economy is still solid, on the back of the high-end consumer, which drives roughly 50% of overall spending,\" he wrote. \"While we see the current market action as a 'typical' drawdown for stocks with NDX and SPX down 10% & 7% from highs, technical measures are signaling fear but not a washout.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 77 points, or 0.2%. The S&P 500 also slid 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite edged 0.1% lower. One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions. Among them: A net 37% of small biz owners expect the economy to improve, down 10 percentage points from January; just 12% said now is a good time to expand, a decrease of 5 points and the biggest monthly drop since April 2020; and a net 32% say they are raising prices, up 10 points for largest monthly increase since April 2021 and the third-highest reading ever. \"There's clearly a tolerance for pain on the part of the administration in pursuit of trade goals that are not necessarily entirely economic in nature,\" said Ross Mayfield, Baird investment strategist. \"At this point I'm still in the camp that we're not on the doorstep of a recession, but maybe a slowdown or growth scare. Non-recession sell-offs tend to be shorter and milder than the recessionary ones.\" Brown's call comes amid a rough patch for the stock, which has dropped just over 11% in 2025. Southwest Airlines announced Tuesday that, for the first time, it will charge passengers to check bags. The move comes as the low-cost airline tries to boost revenue while coming under pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management. \"Given our expectations for a choppy Spring selling season and growing risks to gross margin due to the challenging macro environment and uncertainty around the MRP spin-off, we believe a more cautious stance is warranted,\" Rahmani wrote in a note to clients. \u2014 Katrina Bishop As of Monday's close, 366 S&P 500 components or 73% were trading 10% or more below their respective 52-week highs, which means they have already suffered a correction. A total of 203 components closed more than 20% below 52-week highs\u00a0as of Monday, meaning they are in bear market territory. He also lowered his price target to $141 from $152, which implies 13% upside from Monday's close. Shares are down 8% year to date. Analyst Peter Supino upgraded shares of the New York-based live entertainment operator to outperform from peer perform.

Risk-averse traders might stick with resilient stocks, while traders with hardened nerves could buy stocks falling today in hopes of a rebound. Commodities Indices Stocks See more DJIA ETFs The DJIA isn\u2019t doing so hot today following news of the escalating trade war. This has the index down 0.94% this morning, building on a 4.56% drop over the last three months and a year-to-date decrease of 1.49%. Another option is buying shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the DJIA. There are options for ETFs that bet on or against the index. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) is one popular choice in favor of the index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) continues to drop today as an escalating trade war occupies investors\u2019 minds. The big news affecting the index on Tuesday is President Donald Trump placing an additional 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada. This brings the total tariff on these metals to 50%. Currencies President Trump introduced the new metal tariffs on Canada after Ontario added a 25% energy surcharge to U.S. homes and businesses. Ontario warned it may further increase this energy surcharge or completely cut off energy to the U.S. The President stated that Canada is a \u201ctariff abuser\u201d and that Americans don\u2019t need cars, lumber, or energy from the country. Turning to the TipRanks DJIA heatmap tool, traders will see which stocks are dragging down the index today. There\u2019s plenty of red to be seen on the heatmap as the trade war pulls stocks lower on Tuesday.

There are three risk areas to examine: Normal, Federal Reserve, U.S. Government.\" Front page (A-1): \"Wary Investors Play Defense In Switch to Dividend Stocks\" Unlike risks, uncertainties are hard to measure, both in probability and in possible results. That is why bullish markets tend to ignore them. However, once reality returns, those uncertainties enter investors' thinking. Then, if and when the uncertainties gain shape and weight, investors begin to imagine what else could go wrong. Hence, bulls become bears. \"Designed to protect the beleaguered but politically influential U.S. steel industry, the 2002 tariffs raised costs for companies that used steel in auto parts, metal stamping and more. Though the tariffs were rescinded the next year, the affected companies became less competitive as they tried to sell their own products abroad....\" The leading bearish signs were right: The stock market is at risk of a major selloff.

However, do not expect the good times to return soon. \"Goodbye to overwrought speculation - Hello to enlightened reality.\" Feb. 14 - \"Wall Street's Four Bullish Views Will Likely Reverse\" Why not? Because it takes time for widespread optimism to wash out. In spite of the reality weakening over the past weeks, bullishness remained the driving force. So, why the sudden change? Because the multiple uncertainties and negatives have finally begun to dent investors\u2019 optimism. \"After President Trump was elected, investors got very excited about all the nice things he\u2019d promised and forgot about stuff that would be bad for stocks. Now they are very anxious about all the stuff that is bad for stocks and have forgotten about the nice things.\" \"Economists at global banks are increasingly taking a gloomier outlook, with economists at major banks either upping their recession forecasts or lowering their growth outlooks in recent days.\" \"This isn\u2019t to say that stocks are bad investments. But investors need to understand that while buying and holding stocks for long periods usually pays off, it isn\u2019t guaranteed. Stocks can be risky investments, even if they are held for decades.\" \"Rattled by the threat of trade restrictions and a slowing economy, some investors are turning to a classic defensive play: dividend stocks.\" \"The stock market's behavior is the gauge by which we can measure Wall Street's attitude and outlook.

The US president and his economic team have been priming markets and the American people to expect some pain as a result of their trade policies, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning of a \u201cdetox\u201d period and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying there are certain to be \u201cdistortions.\u201d For now, El-Erian sees growth this year ending up at 1.5% to 2%. He\u2019s factoring in the chance of a recession at 25% to 30%, up from an earlier probability forecast of only 10%. Julie Hyman is the co-host of Market Domination on Yahoo Finance. You can find her on social media @juleshyman. Advertisement The question is how much pain is involved with \"disturbances,\" \"distortions,\" and \"detox.\" The economy grew by 2.8% last year. For this year, the average of economists\u2019 forecasts gathered by Bloomberg shows an expectation of 2.3% growth. Recently, estimates have been coming down as a result of first quarter tariff turmoil. At a \u201cstall speed\u201d of 1% GDP growth or below, what the Trump administration is trying to achieve looks a lot less palatable, Mohamed El-Erian, president at Queens College, Cambridge, and former PIMCO CEO, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. As El-Erian said, \u201cYou're getting a sequencing where the negative effects are being felt first and the positive effects are promised in the future. And that's what the market is getting used to.\u201d \u201cThey want to unleash the private sector through deregulation and favorable tax treatment.\u201d But he emphasizes that a recession is \u201cnot the baseline\" due to the \"structural strength of the US economy,\" as well as promises of deregulation, tax cuts, and cheap energy. \u201cA fairer trading system so that US goods are not discriminated against in global trade.\u201d If the negative effects slow economic growth to 1% or below, the habituation process could be even rockier. \u201cThey want to enhance the efficiency of government.\u201d President Donald Trump this weekend demurred on the question of whether his administration\u2019s trade policies could send the US economy into recession, following up his recent acknowledgement that they may cause a \u201clittle disturbance.\u201d Investors seemed broadly on board with those goals after the election, sending stocks soaring. But the volatile and uneven application of tariffs has now sent markets tumbling and increased the importance of the administration\u2019s planned tax-cut extension and other policies to try to juice growth.

And that\u2019s going to be the big question as we look forward.\u201d", "https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/us-stock-market-crash-wipes-out-4-trillion-donald-trump-global-impact-explained-13870538.html": "The United States stock market experienced a sharp downturn on Monday, triggering massive losses amounting to $4 trillion in market value. In the wake of the sell-off, President Trump, when asked whether he anticipated a recession in 2025, responded to Fox News stating, \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big thing.\u201d The S&P 500 tumbled 2.7 per cent, nearing a 9 per cent drop from its all-time high recorded just last month. At one point during the day, it was down as much as 3.6 per cent, marking its worst trading day since 2022. Copyright @ 2024. Firstpost - All Rights Reserved Protests targeting Tesla dealerships and doubts about workforce stability have further contributed to the sharp decline in its stock value. Analysts believe that Tesla\u2019s downturn was also fuelled by growing concerns about its association with Musk, whose close ties with Trump were initially viewed as an advantage but have now turned into a liability. Similarly, theNasdaq Composite plummeted by 4 per cent, as major tech stocks continued to face severe pressure. One of the most notable impacts of the market crash was seen in technology stocks. Companies like Nvidia, which had soared over 820 per cent from 2023 to 2024, saw their stock value plunge by 5.1 per cent on Monday, pushing their year-to-date losses to more than 20 per cent. With inputs from agencies Mirroring global trends, the Indian stock markets opened on a weaker note on Tuesday. The Sensex slipped 414.05 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 73,701.12 at 9:16 am after opening below the 74,000 mark, while the Nifty 50 declined 140.15 points, or 0.62 per cent, to 22,320.15. is on YouTube The turmoil was not confined to the US market alone. Asian stock markets faced a heavy blow following the Wall Street plunge. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell by 1.7 per cent, Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 dipped by 0.9 per cent, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropped by 1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data showed that the bottom 50 per cent of US households owned only 1 per cent of corporate equities and mutual fund shares, whereas the wealthiest 10 per cent controlled around 87 per cent of such assets. However, these measures have contributed to fears of economic shrinkage, as evidenced by real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The indicators suggest that the US economy may already be contracting. David Mericle, Chief US Economist at Goldman Sachs, slashed his forecast for the country\u2019s economic growth to 1.7 per cent from the earlier estimated 2.2 per cent for the end of 2025, noting that tariffs posed a more significant threat than previously anticipated, reported AP. Tesla, led by Elon Musk, faced an even sharper decline of 15.4 per cent, bringing its total loss for 2025 to 45 per cent. In response to the market turbulence, investors flocked to safer assets like US Treasury bonds, causing their prices to rise sharply and yields to fall. The ripple effect was driven by investor fears that Trump\u2019s trade tariffs would also negatively impact the global economy, especially economies heavily reliant on US exports. Market analysts have attributed the widespread panic touncertainty over Trump\u2019s continued push for protectionist trade policies, which have disrupted supply chains, manufacturing, and investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 890 points, or 2.1 per cent, after trimming an earlier loss of more than 1,100 points. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, responded to the market concerns by stating that Trump\u2019s economic agenda has led to \u201ctrillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of jobs.\u201d Nevertheless, investor sentiment continues to fluctuate as companies remain cautious about the long-term impact of tariffs and reduced government spending. Other major companies dependent on consumer spending also suffered severe losses. Cruise-line operator Carnival Corporation dropped 7.6 per cent, while United Airlines slid by 6.3 per cent. The declining consumer confidence in the US economy has put severe pressure on businesses reliant on discretionary spending. The sell-off was largely driven by growing concerns over President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies, combined with economic uncertainties fuelled by potential government spending cuts and workforce reductions. Also Watch: In China, the Shanghai Composite declined by 0.4 per cent, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell by 0.9 per cent. Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sell-off, which resulted in a staggering $4 trillion loss in market value, has cast a shadow over the US economy and hastriggered fears of a recession. As the week progresses, market participants are closely watching whether lawmakers can pass a funding bill to prevent a partial government shutdown and how Trump\u2019s policies will evolve to stabilise the economy. Wall Street remains highly volatile, with many anticipating further declines if policy uncertainty persists. Goldman Sachs has now increased the probability of a recession within the next year to 20 per cent, citing the increasing uncertainty in fiscal and trade policy. Trump\u2019s administration has been pushing for a series of economic policies aimed at limiting government spending, cutting the federal workforce, and boosting domestic manufacturing.

What's more, the analyst said the company's diversification with M&A can help insulate the business and keep margins stable. Kohl's\u00a0\u2014 Shares of the retailer sank 14% after\u00a0fourth-quarter results\u00a0showed a decline of 9.4% in net sales and full year guidance missed expectations. Kohl's said it expects earnings per share of between 10 cents and 60 cents for the current fiscal year, below the $1.23 expected by analysts, according to LSEG. U.S. stock futures were relatively unchanged Monday night following a broad market sell-off during the day's regular session. Tuesday's call marks a turn for Supino, who downgraded shares to peer perform after the stock was separated from Sphere Entertainment. While Supino said a consumer recession is a risk for share prices, the analyst said to see any cyclical pullbacks as temporary. Kohl's was the biggest laggard in the group and hit its lowest level since January 1997. Shares plunged 22% after the retailer issued disappointing guidance for 2025. Wolfe Research turned bullish on Madison Square Garden Entertainment, saying the stock is pricing in an unlikely stagnation in the entertainment business. \u2014 Jeff Cox Shares were down slightly in the premarket despite the announcement. \"It's become a super cyclical asset \u2014 the first to drop with every bad news [event] as a convenient store of cash, but also the first to recover,\" he added. \"This further underlines why its use as a reserve is questionable but shows it's getting more and more FX-like in its action, so adoption is spreading. \u00a0It would make sense to expect more volatility over the coming months as the world's trade priorities change.\" Tickers that hit this milestone included: \u2014 Leslie Josephs The majority of the stocks in the S&P 500 are already in correction territory as the sell-off on Wall Street continues to drag the benchmark closer to that key threshold. Here's a look at some notable movers in premarket trading. More than four out of five, or 82.27%, of all shares traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Monday fell in price, while only 17.21% advanced, according to FactSet data. The rest were unchanged. The\u00a02-year Treasury\u00a0yield\u00a0dropped as low as 3.829% before recovering slightly to around 3.875%. 203 companies, or 41% of the S&P 500, closed more than 20% below their 52-week highs. The pullback led Citigroup to lower its rating on U.S. stocks to neutral from overweight, pointing to a \"pause in U.S. exceptionalism\" as the reason. Adding to worries around the economy was the latest guidance from Delta Air Lines. The company slashed its earnings outlook due to weaker U.S. demand, pushing the stock down more than 8%. Stocks kicked off Tuesday's session in the red, extending their losses from Monday's sell-off. The stock's outperformance came after Trump posted on Tuesday morning that he planned to purchase a Tesla and blasted a boycott of the brand. Tesla has been under scrutiny as CEO Elon Musk has opined on international politics and was notably tapped to lead Trump's controversial government cost-cutting initiative. \u2014 Sean Conlon In a Truth Social post, Trump said steel and aluminum duties would double to 50% from 25%, effective Wednesday. This is the latest in a series of escalating trade policy moves that have stoked fears of a U.S. economic recession. The White House has placed tariffs on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese imports, leading to steep losses in equities. Shares popped 1.6% before the bell on Tuesday. However, shares have tumbled around 14% in 2025. Wells Fargo issued a rare double-upgrade, calling Houlihan Lokey the right stock to play during the ongoing market volatility. On Monday, the Nasdaq saw its worst day since September 2022, dropping 4%. The 30-stock Dow, which lost nearly 900 points, closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 1, 2023. Shares of Revolve Group, Foot Locker and American Eagle Outfitters were all trading more than 5% lower. \u2014 Nick Wells, Lisa Kailai Han \u2014 Yun Li Southwest Airlines\u00a0\u2014 Shares of the budget airline jumped almost 10% after the company announced that it will start\u00a0charging passengers\u00a0to check bags and will begin offering a basic economy fare. The\u00a0SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT)\u00a0was last trading 2.1% lower on Tuesday and pacing for back-to-back losses. Shares of the electric vehicle maker rose more than 1% shortly before 11 a.m. ET, on track to snap a three-day losing streak. By comparison, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, meanwhile, told clients on Monday that they should buy into Tesla after the stock's steep decline. Shares have plunged about 45% this year, including a slide of more than 15% seen in Monday's session that marked its worst day since 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday after President Donald Trump placed additional tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum coming into the U.S. \u2014 Scott Schnipper On Tuesday, 14 stocks in the S&P 500 were trading at new 52-week lows. Supino noted that Madison Square Garden's events for the first quarter of 2026 are trending above the record set in the same three-month period a year prior, which he said offers a \"positive early signal\" for the fiscal year. A potential renovation of Penn Station would be a \"windfall,\" he added. While job losses from Elon Musk's new Department of Government Efficiency may have sent shockwaves through the market, these mass losses are unlikely to make a huge difference in any upcoming monetary policy decisions, according to Barclays. Also, the survey's Uncertainty Index increased to 104, a rise of 4 points and the second-highest reading in the survey's history, which dates to 1973. When asked about the possibility of a recession, Trump said during a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday that the economy was going through \"a period of transition.\" The remarks arrived after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Friday that there could be a \"detox period\" for the economy as the Trump administration slashes federal spending. U.S. Treasury yields continued to slide on Tuesday as fears of a possible U.S. recession pushed investors to safe havens. On the other hand, just four stocks in the index hit new 52-week highs: CME Group, Bristol-Myers, Cencora and CenterPoint Energy. \"We continue to believe that the U.S. economy is still solid, on the back of the high-end consumer, which drives roughly 50% of overall spending,\" he wrote. \"While we see the current market action as a 'typical' drawdown for stocks with NDX and SPX down 10% & 7% from highs, technical measures are signaling fear but not a washout.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 77 points, or 0.2%. The S&P 500 also slid 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite edged 0.1% lower. One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions. Among them: A net 37% of small biz owners expect the economy to improve, down 10 percentage points from January; just 12% said now is a good time to expand, a decrease of 5 points and the biggest monthly drop since April 2020; and a net 32% say they are raising prices, up 10 points for largest monthly increase since April 2021 and the third-highest reading ever. \"There's clearly a tolerance for pain on the part of the administration in pursuit of trade goals that are not necessarily entirely economic in nature,\" said Ross Mayfield, Baird investment strategist. \"At this point I'm still in the camp that we're not on the doorstep of a recession, but maybe a slowdown or growth scare. Non-recession sell-offs tend to be shorter and milder than the recessionary ones.\" Brown's call comes amid a rough patch for the stock, which has dropped just over 11% in 2025. Southwest Airlines announced Tuesday that, for the first time, it will charge passengers to check bags. The move comes as the low-cost airline tries to boost revenue while coming under pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management. \"Given our expectations for a choppy Spring selling season and growing risks to gross margin due to the challenging macro environment and uncertainty around the MRP spin-off, we believe a more cautious stance is warranted,\" Rahmani wrote in a note to clients. \u2014 Katrina Bishop As of Monday's close, 366 S&P 500 components or 73% were trading 10% or more below their respective 52-week highs, which means they have already suffered a correction. A total of 203 components closed more than 20% below 52-week highs\u00a0as of Monday, meaning they are in bear market territory. He also lowered his price target to $141 from $152, which implies 13% upside from Monday's close. Shares are down 8% year to date. Analyst Peter Supino upgraded shares of the New York-based live entertainment operator to outperform from peer perform. Supino's $46 price target suggests shares can rally 50.4% over Monday's closing level.", "https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/dow-s-p-nasdaq-decline-after-trump-announces-fresh-tariffs-on-canada-125031101331_1.html": "Reference #18.d0643017.1741710669.461b40bhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.d0643017.1741710669.461b40b https://errors.edgesuite.net/18.d0643017.1741710669.461b40b", "https://www.aol.com/finance/stretch-financial-wellness-150407266.html": "Choosing the right budgeting app starts with understanding your financial needs and habits. To determine if Stretch is a fit for you, consider these questions: Debt management focus: Unlike some general budgeting apps, Stretch provides specific tools for monitoring and reducing debt, including credit score visibility. Stretch Financial Wellness is an app designed to help users manage their finances with a focus on debt management, real-time insights and guidance for making financial progress. Stretch does have notable advantages, including its user-friendly interface, emphasis on progress over perfection and the ability to make payments directly through the app. Unlike some competitors, it offers a free version, albeit with significant limitations. Financial education: Learn what you need to know with easy-to-understand info designed to boost your financial confidence and knowledge. The competitive budgeting app landscape includes alternatives like You Need a Budget (YNAB) and PocketGuard, which offer similar benefits at comparable price points. Before committing, you can take advantage of Stretch\u2019s free trial period to determine if its features align with your financial management style. This hands-on experience will reveal whether the app\u2019s interface, notification system and debt-tracking capabilities provide genuine value for your situation. Stretch includes features for tracking debt, monitoring credit scores and creating payment plans that may help with credit card debt management. Though marketed as a comprehensive financial wellness tool, Stretch may not adequately serve those with complex financial situations due to its limited personalization and absence of human advisor support. Advertisement Categorized spending insights: The app organizes spending into categories to help users understand spending patterns and make adjustments. This financial literacy gap is reflected in Americans\u2019 saving habits. According to\u00a0Bankrate\u2019s 2024 Emergency Savings Report, 32 percent of consumers have less money in savings than they did a year ago, and 9 percent say they have no savings at all. The $12.99 monthly fee for the Vision subscription may be counterproductive for budget-conscious users, especially since the free version only supports one credit card. Considering the average American has 3.84 credit cards, many users would need to upgrade to the paid plan for full functionality. Financial marketplace: Users can explore financial products from selected institutions, including credit cards, loans, bank accounts and more. Customized goal setting: Define and track goals like saving for an emergency fund, staying within a budget or paying off debt. Can Stretch help pay off credit card debt? Stretch Financial Wellness (simply known as \u201cStretch\u201d) aims to take financial management further by focusing on where your money can take you rather than just showing how you spend it. Let\u2019s examine Stretch\u2019s features, benefits and limitations to help you determine if it\u2019s right for your financial goals. Reputable budgeting apps typically employ secure encryption and follow privacy standards to protect financial data. Before signing up for any financial service, verify its security features and privacy policy. Financial stress affects more than your bank account. According to the American Psychological Association, 63 percent of Americans cite money as a significant source of stress. This stress can impact mental health, daily functioning and even physical wellbeing. Are budgeting apps trustworthy? Real-time insights: Get up-to-date notifications on your spending and savings so you can adjust in the moment. The app provides tools to help users understand their financial situation, plan for the future and work toward personal financial goals. It approaches financial management by breaking down complex concepts into more manageable steps and providing actionable insights. Stretch aims to differentiate itself from standard budgeting apps by offering more comprehensive tools for financial management. While budgeting apps are plentiful, Stretch offers several useful features: Stretch offers a 7-day free trial, after which the Vision subscription costs $9.99 monthly for the first three months with promotional code SAVE3FOR3. Regular pricing is $12.99 monthly. Financial wellness extends beyond money management \u2014 it\u2019s about having the freedom to make choices that improve your quality of life without constant financial worry. Whether handling unexpected expenses or saving for long-term goals, financial wellness provides greater control over your money and increased peace of mind. But there\u2019s good news: Working toward financial goals, such as debt reduction or emergency fund building, typically correlates with increased confidence and security regardless of income level. Financial wellness creates stability that can improve overall quality of life. In these cases, you might be better served by financial planning software with more advanced features, consulting with a financial advisor, or using free spreadsheet templates designed for budgeting. For premium support please call: Have basic budgeting apps failed to give you the structure and motivation you need? Do you need guidance to develop better financial habits but don\u2019t want to hire a financial advisor? Centralized dashboard: The Vision subscription allows users to link banking accounts, credit cards and various debts including student loans, car loans and mortgages. In behavioral economics, there\u2019s a concept called \u201cnudging\u201d \u2014 small, thoughtful prompts that help us make better decisions without being intrusive. Budgeting apps often claim to be that nudge, but not all of them deliver. Some simply log your spending after the fact, while others try to guide you toward smarter money habits in real time. Would real-time spending insights and reminders help you make better financial decisions? In-app notifications: Through text or email, Stretch provides reminders about financial goals and payments. Is debt management (especially credit cards) a primary financial goal for you? Do you prefer having all your accounts \u2014 loans, credit cards and savings \u2014 visible in one dashboard? Does Stretch charge fees for its features? Users with debt from smaller lenders using less advanced technology may find that Stretch doesn\u2019t fully integrate with these institutions. Similarly, those managing finances across multiple countries will likely find the app insufficient for their needs, as Stretch isn\u2019t designed to handle international financial complexities. If you\u2019re particularly focused on debt management and benefit from real-time feedback, Stretch\u2019s comprehensive dashboard might justify its $12.99 monthly subscription cost. The app can serve as a middle ground between basic free budgeting tools and more expensive financial advisory services. If you answered yes to most of these questions, Stretch could be beneficial. However, consider alternative solutions if you have complex financial circumstances requiring personalized advice, manage finances across international borders, are already comfortable using spreadsheets or other low-cost alternatives, or find that the subscription cost doesn\u2019t fit your budget. Stretch offers these key features: That said, Stretch isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution for financial planning or budgeting. While it offers helpful features, there are some limitations to consider. The 2024 TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index shows that financial literacy in the U.S. has remained at about 50 percent for eight years, with a 2 percent decline in the past two years. This knowledge gap often leads to financial decisions that can make progress difficult.", "https://www.aol.com/finance/international-etfs-invest-foreign-emerging-125649172.html": "Like domestic exchange-traded funds, international ETFs provide a low-cost option to diversify and access a wide range of investment themes. Fund performance: Numbers don\u2019t lie. So while you do your research, take a look at a fund\u2019s short-, mid-, and long-term performance. With the rapid rise of technological advancements, supply chain and logistics reliance, and other competing factors that come into play in the global economy, international markets could retake the lead. For new and seasoned investors alike, taking a global approach to your investments can help provide diversification and multiple ways to benefit from the growth in the world economy. While putting your money in foreign markets might sound complex, there are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) set up to streamline the process and make it easy for those in the U.S. to invest internationally. An example of an actively managed ETF is WisdomTree\u2019s Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund (ELD), which invests in government and corporate bonds denominated in the currencies of emerging market countries like Brazil, Thailand and Colombia. For example, according to Vanguard\u2019s recommendation, a portfolio containing $10,000 in stocks should have up to $4,000 allocated to international stocks. Trading volume: The more liquid a fund is, the easier it will be to buy and sell. Look at how average trading volume compares to similar ETFs. When investing internationally, the first step is to understand how world markets are classified, as each country and geographic region carries varying risk/reward profiles. In developed markets, you\u2019ll usually find countries with mature capital markets, broad regulatory bodies, advanced infrastructure, and other economic stability factors. Countries like the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Japan belong to this category. As a result, their investment profiles closely match the United States. Contrary to index funds, active investing depends on a fund manager\u2019s ability to pick securities and provide above-average returns. As a result, these investments often come with higher fees and greater volatility than passive ETFs. Investments in international stocks come with additional sources of volatility. Factors such as limited market regulation, varying accounting practices, political instability and currency fluctuations could dampen equity returns. Within the ETF sphere, there are two options for how securities are selected: Passive and actively managed funds. There are plenty of ETF screening tools, including those provided by most brokerage firms. You can screen by factors like geographic region, fees, trading performance, assets under management and so forth. As you narrow your options, the key features to consider are: In emerging markets, you\u2019ll typically find countries that exhibit accelerated economic growth, often driven by younger populations, infrastructure modernization, technological advancements and higher levels of consumer spending. Countries like Brazil, India and South Korea are some examples. Although this type of investing may appear unnecessary to some, having assets outside the U.S. can serve as a valuable hedge against domestic market fluctuations and provides the potential for greater returns in both developed and emerging markets. In a passively managed ETF, a fund manager buys a basket of international stocks that make up a broad index. Through a single ETF, you gain exposure to the entire index. This process eliminates the need for fund managers to select individual companies at their discretion. Therefore, management fees are usually low. Investing in emerging markets may present opportunities for higher returns than in developed economies. However, there\u2019s also a greater risk of losses, as these countries tend to experience more frequent economic and political instability. Advertisement Assets under management (AUM): Many investors use this figure as a vote of confidence to assess other investors\u2019 engagement with a particular ETF. Along with AUM figures, it might be helpful to check the longevity of the fund. Depending on your financial goals, asset allocation and risk tolerance, there are various strategies for investing in international stocks. Your level of financial knowledge and engagement with your investments also plays a factor. Like all investments, both domestic and international ETFs carry various sets of risks. Those risks can be market-specific such as stock valuations, or they can be macro risks, such as high government debt levels, which can lead to inflation. The main categories are developed, emerging and frontier markets. After you determine your comfort level, it is time to select the type of international ETFs you want to buy. However, according to Vanguard\u2019s research, investors could mitigate some of those risks with the correct diversification levels. Remember, a sector or region might be hot today and then quickly fall out of favor. Fund issuer: Brands are powerful. And that\u2019s no different in the ETF space. Some investors feel comfortable only investing in large asset managers, while others see the value in newcomers. Decide what works for you and your financial needs. Having limited exposure to foreign stocks may seem like a positive when the U.S. market is outperforming. But when global trends shift, you could miss out on the potential for higher returns and lower volatility. Among the three groups, frontier markets carry the highest risk of political, economic and currency instability. Nevertheless, higher risk generally correlates with the possibility of higher returns, which is why some investors opt to maintain limited exposure to frontier markets. Emerging markets ETF top holdings: By law, fund companies need to disclose their holdings, which is beneficial for investors as it provides transparency. It\u2019s also helpful to decide whether those investments line up with your financial goals. Editorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation. \u2014 Bankrate\u2019s Brian Baker contributed to an update of this article. Some investors also find international stocks to be more attractively priced than U.S. companies in early 2025. The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) was up about 8 percent in 2025 as of March 7, compared to a nearly 2 percent decline for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). Developed markets Frontier markets Once you determine your financial goals, decide what percentage of your total portfolio allocation you will invest in international stocks or bonds. Before we dive into classification, remember there is no single country or region that provides total exposure to the global economy \u2014 thus the case for diversifying internationally. When selecting an international ETF, pay attention to the fund\u2019s top holdings, along with investment distributions across sectors and regions. The key is to align your investments with your desired asset allocation without being overexposed to one area of the market. Expense ratios and fees: By default, most ETF providers charge competitive fees. But even at relatively low levels those fees can add up, so make sure to compare apples-to-apples and read the fine print. For premium support please call: For example, the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU) tracks the FTSE All-World ex-US index\u2019s performance. The index includes more than 3,000 stocks of companies in developed and emerging markets in 48 countries, excluding the U.S. By purchasing this ETF, you aim to replicate the benchmark\u2019s performance. A combination of passive and active managed funds could also make sense for investors with a higher tolerance for risk and volatility. Use the factors above as a guide to discovering your next international ETF. Even if you chose to own large U.S. companies exclusively, chances are you already have some international exposure. In the twenty-first century, multinational companies derive a significant portion of their revenue from international developed and emerging markets. For example, the U.S. market has outperformed international stocks over the past decade, boosted by solid gains in the technology sector. However, until the 2008 global financial crisis, it was international markets that led the way. International stocks have also outperformed to kick off 2025. For most investors, passively managed international ETFs are likely the best option. Intended as a buy-and-hold strategy, they provide automatic diversification and free investors from consistently monitoring market developments. Consider historical fluctuations in market leadership, which usually alternate between the U.S. and international stocks. Vanguard recommends investing up to 40 percent of your total equity allocation in international stocks and up to 30 percent of your bond allocation in international bonds to get the full benefits of diversification. Here\u2019s what you need to know about identifying the best international ETFs and how they might fit in your portfolio. Meanwhile, frontier economies have limited links to the global financial system as their capital markets might be too small or underdeveloped. Therefore, trading volumes are often low and investment participation is limited. Another risk to consider with international ETFs is the potential for overlap in country weightings. Fund managers often act based on market opportunities. Therefore, equity holdings in specific sectors or regions could be similar across multiple ETFs. Countries like Vietnam, Nigeria and Bangladesh are thought to be part of this category. By shifting your focus overseas, you can mitigate the risk of what\u2019s called \u201chome bias,\u201d or the tendency for investors to hold the majority of their portfolios in domestic assets. Home bias dilutes the benefits of diversification when trends change.", "https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-recession-risk-provides-tinder-smoldering-market-volatility-2025-03-10/": "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4766289-buy-the-dip-big-dividend-growth-stocks-with-major-upside-catalysts": " This article was written by Learn more We invest thousands of hours and over $100,000 annually into researching the most profitable investment opportunities\u00e2\u0080\u0094all to bring you high-yield strategies at just a fraction of the cost.

China's CSI 300 was 0.1% higher. Trump has downplayed the economic fallout from tariffs, saying the US economy will head into a \"period of transition\" and adjustment. During a Sunday interview, he also did not rule out a recession, spooking markets. \"In the case of a US recession and large-scale wealth destruction, and because of the sharp rise in foreign sovereign bond yields, there seems scope for de-risking of USD assets,\" they wrote. The sell-off in US stock markets fueled by fears of a recession could prompt investors to put their money elsewhere, changing up global financial flows. Indices Some foreign investors may repatriate their money home. In time, a new global reserve currency could emerge alongside the dollar. On Tuesday, Asian shares opened lower but pared losses over the trading day. \"After all there remains no meaningful alternative to the USD as the world's reserve currency, wrote the Nomura analysts. \"It would have sounded fanciful only a month ago, but after Europe's fiscal paradigm shift, perhaps it could be the euro,\" Nomura analysts wrote. Commodities On Sunday, Goldman Sachs said some investors are considering entering China's stock markets again as equities in the world's second-largest economy stage a resurgence following the boost from the DeepSeek hype. Foreign investors \u2014 who hold $17.6 trillion worth of US equities \u2014 could be tempted to pull some of their money from the US. However, this may not be the case if a recession occurs. If the US economy slows but doesn't slip into a recession, foreign investors may reallocate their holdings from US equities to US debt, wrote Nomura. As Trump's America First policy reverberates across the world, major economies \u2014 including Europe and China \u2014 are ramping up policy stimulus to boost growth. Their moves could make these markets more attractive for investors. Stocks Monday's selloff comes as investors are already weighing massive changes in the US that have heightened policy uncertainty, including tariffs, deportations, and massive DOGE job cuts. These changes could undermine economic risk growth and increase recession risk, in turn hitting the $60 trillion US stock market. \"Our latest investor conversations suggest that global LO mandates have become more engaged in Chinese capital market transactions (IPOs and placements) of late, and are increasingly motivated to add to the public market given the recent weakness and volatility in the US stock market where their allocations are close to all-time highs,\" wrote Goldman Sachs' analysts, referring to long-only mandates from mutual funds.

The consumer watchdog agency that has been largely shuttered by the Trump administration had asked a federal court earlier this month to pause its enforcement action against the bank. It is one of several high-profile lawsuits the agency has moved to either scrap or pause under new leadership. A stay could negatively affect Comerica and the CFPB has failed to identify a hardship or other reason it cannot continue litigating this case, a judge in the Northern District of Texas said in the denial.

It\u2019s already intense as evidenced by the presence of Visa, American Express, Discover, Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, ApplePay, and various crypto entrants too numerous to list. The cost of financial transactions is headed to zero. Whether credit cards, debit cards, person-to-person, crypto, and surely beyond, the costs are poised to fall. ByJohn Tamny An illustration photo shows a display of credit cards on September 12, 2023 in Los Angeles, ... [+] California. Credit card debt from US consumers is rising by billions of dollars amid higher inflation and interest rates, topping $1 trillion for the first time in history, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP) (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) Notable about Visa\u2019s achievements is that they took place in the face of other legislation, including the Durbin Amendment, which among other things price-controlled swipe fees on debit cards to the detriment of users. Yet even with the barriers erected, Visa succeeded in making debit cards the primary way that individuals interact with their hard-earned money. What\u2019s important about all this is that Visa is not done innovating. Evidence supporting this claim can be found in the previously-mentioned truth that victors in any sector are invariably the ones most successful when it comes to driving down prices. All of which explains why it\u2019s necessary for the Trump administration to quickly reverse the Biden administration\u2019s errors. Competition is already fierce, and Visa is one of the best competitors. Rather than saddle it with government harassment, let\u2019s get government out of the way so that Visa can try its hand at inventing a payments future that will vastly improve on the present. In short, Trump should call off the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit precisely because he aims to bring down transaction costs for consumers as quickly as possible. Exactly because production is exploding globally, so are efforts by a myriad of entities to facilitate all this exchange. Despite this, the DOJ is presently attacking Visa for succeeding in a space (debit) that is already defined by enormous competition, and that will include quite a bit more in the near and long term. Which means Visa\u2019s success in debit isn\u2019t anti-competitive as the DOJ contends, rather it\u2019s a powerful signal that it uniquely anticipated a growing market for lower-cost card payments. Despite this, Zelle recently found itself under attack from the mis-named Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), credit and debt card issuers have endured all manner of federal attempts to price control swipe fees, not to mention that Visa is presently the target of a Department of Justice antitrust suit related to debit cards. It\u2019s time to reverse these superfluous encroachments. Even better, President Trump should thrill at doing this exactly because it would involve undoing errors made on the watch of his predecessor, Joe Biden. The good news is that the Trump administration has already gotten started. Even though Zelle was created to make payments and cash exchanges much safer from fraud and abuse, the CFPB made it its aim during Biden\u2019s presidency to saddle banks with the cost of any fraud or theft that took place with the payments system. Thankfully the Trump administration has already rolled back the CFPB\u2019s actions. And while there\u2019s much more to do, the next step should be for it to call off the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) antitrust suit against Visa. Which is why it\u2019s essential that the Trump administration call off the regulatory and antitrust watchdogs presently gnashing their teeth at the businesses trying to invent the future of payments. The above prediction is rendered a certainty by the happy truth that the most highly valued U.S. corporations are invariably the ones that provide the most for the least.

The biggest concerns weighing down on investor sentiment is that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could push prices higher in the US,\u00a0pushing the Federal Reserve to hold on higher rates for longer, further damaging economic growth.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average\u00a0and S&P 500\u00a0were down 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively, in recent trading, while the tech-heavy\u00a0Nasdaq was down 0.3%. Stocks kicked off the week with sharp losses after big declines last week, as investors have grown increasingly concerned about the potential impact of policies coming from the Trump White House and the possibility that the economy could slip into a recession. Kohl's\u00a0missed estimates last quarter, when its said craft store chain Michaels Cos. CEO Ashley Buchanan would be replacing Tom Kingsbury as chief executive. In a presentation ahead of its Investor Day, the company said that it sees short-term volatility \"mainly in SemiTest business,\" as well as new uncertainty around tariffs and trade restrictions. It added it doesn\u2019t expect cancellations, \"but some push outs and capital reviews.\" Despite the lowered guidance, shares of Southwest jumped 9% as the airline also announced it would end a longstanding policy of not charging fees on checked bags. Investors should monitor key support levels on Tesla's chart around $215 and $165, while also watching major resistance levels near $265 and $300. S&P 500 futures rose 0.5%. Bitcoin was at $80,700 in recent trading, down from an earlier high of $82,100 but up from an overnight low of $76,600. The digital currency has been trading at its lowest levels since November. The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which has slumped in recent weeks as the concerns about the health of the economy have mounted, was at 4.24% recently, up from 4.21% at yesterday's close. The economic data calendar is light today, but investors will be paying close attention to the consumer price index report that is due to be released tomorrow morning. The Nasdaq Composite's 4% decline yesterday marked its biggest one-day drop since 2022, while the S&P 500 and Dow both had their worst days since December. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are at their lowest levels since September, as major indexes have wiped away all the gains that led to a series of record highs after the presidential election. Kohl's shares were down 15% in recent trading and have lost more than 60% of their value over the past year. The stock dipped below $10 for the first time since 1997 this morning. Analytics software provider Palantir (PLTR) and advertising platform AppLovin (APP), two AI investor favorites that have been hit hard recently, were up nearly 3% and 5%, respectively. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) rose more than 6%. Major Stock Index Futures Point to Higher Open Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.6%. Tesla shares fell below the closely watched 200-week moving average in Monday\u2019s trading session. Moreover, increasing\u00a0volumes\u00a0have accompanied the recent drop, signaling selling participation by larger market players, such as\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0and hedge funds. -Aaron McDade On Tuesday, Trump said on his Truth Social platform that tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Canada would be 50% starting Wednesday, up from the 25% rates that were due to go into effect. Trump said the decision was retaliation for Ontario's decision to impose a 25% tariff on electricity exports from the province to the U.S. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.4%. Shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA), which fell 15% yesterday to lead the tech sector rout, were up 3.5% in recent trading. The stock has fallen more than 50% from its mid-December record high amid investor concerns about how CEO Elon Musk's heavy involvement in the Trump administration could affect the company's brand image and sales. Southwest shares were up more than 6% in recent trading. Despite Tuesday's gains, they've lost about 10% of their value since the start of the year. The changes follow\u00a0months of disputes\u00a0with Elliott, which\u00a0built a stake\u00a0in Southwest last year and\u00a0pushed for changes\u00a0at the executive\u00a0and board level. In October, the sides\u00a0agreed to a settlement\u00a0that saw five Elliott-backed candidates added to Southwest's board. Also on Tuesday, Southwest lowered its projected growth for first-quarter revenue per available seat mile to\u00a0a year-over-year increase of 2% to 4%, from 5% to 7% previously. -Timothy Smith Tesla (TSLA) shares moved slightly higher in premarket trading after tumbling 15% on Monday to lead S&P decliners, closing below their Election Day level for the first time. Shares of automakers lost ground on the news, with General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) were down 2.5% and 4%, respectively, while Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLA) dropped 4.5%. Investors fear that Trump's wide-ranging efforts to impose tariffs will harm companies that source parts and products from other countries and that do business around the world, especially as other countries introduce retaliatory measures. The trade levies, economists say, are also likely to spur inflation and cause economic growth to slow. Gold futures were up 0.9% at $2,925 an ounce, while West Texas intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, rose 1% to $66.70 per barrel. Tesla Prices to Watch After Stock's 50% Decline from Record While the\u00a0relative strength index confirms bearish momentum with a reading below 50, the indicator has moved into a region that has typically corresponded with bounces in the stock stretching back to May 2022. Shares of Verizon (VZ) were down 7%, leading Dow decliners this morning, after the telecommunications giant warned of weak subscriber growth. Kohl's Stock Plunges on Disappointing Outlook Shares of Teradyne (TER) plummeted to lead\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0decliners Tuesday, as the maker of testing equipment for chips and electronics updated its guidance in response to the potential impact of Trump administration trade moves. The introduction of baggage fees are the newest change for Southwest, which in July\u00a0announced an end\u00a0to its famed open seating policy and introduced overnight flights, which started last month. The airline has since said it plans to start booking assigned seating flights in the second half of this year and roll out the changes in 2026. Other mega-cap tech stocks were mixed. Apple (AAPL) shares were down more than 3%, while Google-parent Alphabet\u00a0(GOOG) fell 1.5% and Microsoft (MSFT) was down slightly. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was up 1.5%, while rival Broadcom (AVGO) added 3%, and Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META)\u00a0also gained ground. Comparable store sales fell by 6.7%, a bit better than the 6.9% decline that analysts had projected. In addition to the update, Teradyne also announced it bought privately held Quantifi Photonics for an undisclosed price. Quantifi manufactures photonic integrated circuit testing devices. The department store chain's fiscal fourth-quarter results were mixed, with\u00a0profits\u00a0lagging analysts' projections. It posted EPS of $0.43 on net revenue of $5.4 billion. (After adjusting for one-time costs like store closures, Kohl's adjusted EPS of $0.95 topped estimates.) Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected $0.71 and $5.38 billion, respectively. Last year, Kohl's registered profit of $1.67 per share and sales of $5.96 billion. Southwest Jumps After News of Baggage Fees Airline stocks were down after Delta (DAL), American (AAL) and Southwest (LUV), all lowered their outlooks. Delta, which cut its sales and profit guidance\u00a0for the first quarter, citing economic \"uncertainty\" that has hit travel demand, was off more than 8%. Shares of American fell nearly 6%, while United Airlines (UAL) dropped 3%. Shares of Kohl's (KSS) plunged in early trading after the struggling retailer's forecasts fell short of analysts' expectations. TradingView The stock was up 0.4% at $223 in recent premarket trading. Since hitting a record high in mid-December, Tesla shares have fallen 55% amid investor concerns about potential fallout from Musk's extensive involvement in the Trump administration and weak sales figures. Michael Nagle / Bloomberg / Getty Images The airline said it would introduce a basic economy ticket option and baggage fees, ending some of Southwest's\u00a0trademark perks. Certain members of the airline's rewards program will still be eligible for one or two free checked bags once the policy changes for flights booked on or after May 28. For fiscal 2025, Kohl's projects net sales to fall 5% to 7%, comparable sales to fall 4% to 6%, and\u00a0earnings per share (EPS)\u00a0of between $0.10 and $0.60. Analysts were looking for 2025 net sales to decline by about 2%, comparable sales to decline by 1.83%, and EPS of $1.26, according to Visible Alpha data. Read the full technical analysis piece here. Southwest Airlines (LUV) shares surged Tuesday after the airline announced its latest revenue-generating changes amid pressure from\u00a0activist investor\u00a0Elliott Investment Management. Stocks were lower in early-afternoon trading Tuesday after the Trump administration unveiled higher tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, as concerns about political and economic uncertainty continue to spark market volatility. Teradyne didn't forecast any changes to its outlook for the current quarter\u00a0but anticipates second-quarter revenue to be flat to down 10% from the first quarter and full-year revenue up 5% to 10% year-over-year.

It takes a little time.\u201d Seth Wenig/Associated Press The economy has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism. And a widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the U.S. economy may already be shrinking. At Goldman Sachs, for example, David Mericle cut his estimate for U.S. economic growth to 1.7% from 2.2% for the end of 2025 over the year before, largely because tariffs look like they\u2019ll be bigger than he was previously forecasting. The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled again to 4.22% from 4.32% late Friday. It\u2019s been dropping since January, when it was approaching 4.80%, as worries about the economy have grown. That\u2019s a major move for the bond market. It\u2019s not just stocks struggling. Investors are sending prices lower for all kinds of investments whose momentum had earlier seemed nearly impossible to stop at times, such as bitcoin. The cryptocurrency\u2019s value has dropped below $80,000 from more than $106,000 in December. Search The S&P 500 dropped 2.7% to drag it close to 9% below its all-time high, which was set just last month. At one point, the S&P 500 was down 3.6% and on track for its worst day since 2022. That\u2019s when the highest inflation in generations was shredding budgets and raising worries about a possible recession that ultimately never came. Financial news reports play as people work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. ServiceNow fell 7.9% after the AI platform company said it was buying AI-assistant maker Moveworks for $2.85 billion in cash and stock. Terms of Use \u2022 Privacy Notice \u2022 Cookie Policy \u2022 Terms of Sale Stocks of companies that depend on U.S. households feeling good enough about their finances to spend also fell sharply.

Alvarez/Associated Press In stock markets abroad, European indexes largely fell following a mixed session in Asia. Instead, investors have bid up U.S. Treasury bonds as they look for things whose prices can hold up better when the economy is under pressure. That has sent prices for Treasurys sharply higher, which in turn has sent down their yields. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 890 points, or 2.1%, after paring an earlier loss of more than 1,100, while the Nasdaq composite skidded by 4%. Nvidia fell another 5.1% Monday to bring its loss for the year so far to more than 20%. It\u2019s a steep drop-off from its nearly 820% surge over 2023 and 2024. Indexes fell 1.8% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai after China said consumer prices fell in February for the first time in 13 months. It\u2019s the latest signal of weakness for the world\u2019s second-largest economy, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday. President Donald Trump exits Air Force One Sunday after arriving at Joint Base Andrews, Md. Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla fell 15.4% to deepen its loss for 2025 to 45%. After getting an initial post-election bump on hopes that Musk\u2019s close relationship with Trump would help the electric-vehicle company, the stock has slumped on worries that its brand has become intertwined with Musk. Protests against the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to cull its workforce and other moves have targeted Tesla dealerships, for example. Share \u201cThere are always multiple forces at work in the market, but right now, almost all of them are taking a back seat to tariffs,\u201d according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. All the uncertainty, though, hasn\u2019t shut down dealmaking on Wall Street. Redfin\u2019s stock jumped 67.9% after Rocket said it would buy the digital real estate brokerage in an all-stock deal valuing it at $1.75 billion. Rocket\u2019s stock sank 15.3%. It was the worst day yet in a scary stretch where the S&P 500 has swung more than 1%, up or down, seven times in eight days because of Trump\u2019s on -and- off -again tariffs. The worry is that the whipsaw moves will either hurt the economy directly or create enough uncertainty to drive U.S. companies and consumers into an economy-freezing paralysis. The U.S. job market is still showing stable hiring at the moment, to be sure, and the economy ended last year running at a solid rate. But economists are marking down their forecasts for how the economy will perform this year. Trump met on Monday with tech industry CEOs, but the event was closed to the news media. He remained silent about the sell-off through the day. NEW YORK \u2014 The U.S. stock market\u2019s sell-off cut deeper on Monday as Wall Street questioned how much pain President Donald Trump will let the economy endure through tariffs and other policies in order to get what he wants. Trump says he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, among other reasons he\u2019s given for tariffs. His Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has also said the economy may go through a \u201cdetox\u201d period as it weans off an addiction to spending by the government. The White House is trying to limit federal spending, while also cutting the federal workforce and increasing deportations, which could hinder the job market.", "https://www.morningstar.com.au/insights/markets/261863/market-outlook-how-investors-with-us-shares-should-respond-to-tariffs-uncertainty-in-march": "According to our valuations, on both an absolute and relative value basis, we think the rotation into value stocks still has room to run. Not only are value stocks more attractively valued, we think the rotation into value will pick up steam as the economy slows and growth stocks\u2019 earnings growth begins to slow.  Looking forward, we expect there will be a wide range of valuation outcomes from a little to a lot, depending on the amount of margin compression and how long that compression will last. Bucking the trend are communication services and consumer defensive. The communication-services sector has become more undervalued following several notable increases in our fair values on stocks such as Alphabet GOOGL and Meta META. Consumer defensive has become further overvalued and is now the most overvalued at a 17% premium. The three stocks that account for the greatest percentage of the sector\u2019s market capitalization, Walmart WMT, Costco COST, and Procter & Gamble PG, have risen 7%, 12%, and 9%, respectively, for the year to date. is chief U.S. market strategist for Morningstar. Examples of sectors that would be negatively affected by higher tariffs on Chinese imports include apparel and apparel retailers, such as Macy\u2019s M and Kohl\u2019s KSS, which lack the pricing power to push through cost increases. Best Buy BBY could be under especially intense pressure as China accounts for 60% of its cost of goods sold, and Mexico is the company\u2019s second-largest source. Similarly, technology companies like Apple AAPL that import electronic goods from China would have to raise prices substantially to maintain their margins. Companies with facilities in Mexico, such as automakers Ford F and General Motors GM and power sports equipment maker Polaris PII, would be unlikely to quickly pass through tariffs. In addition, distributors of Mexican products, such as Constellation Brands STZ, would have difficulty quickly passing through price increases. Yet not all companies would be negatively affected. Companies that have greater domestic sourcing or source from areas not subject to tariffs as compared with their competitors may benefit. Other companies that have strong pricing power may be able to quickly pass through those added costs, and assuming only a modest pullback in volume, could see their earnings rise. In such an environment, what\u2019s an investor to do? Investors should focus on the fundamentals, maintain a long-term mindset, and pay attention to valuations. And that is just what our analyst team is doing, scrutinizing the long-term fundamentals underlying sector outlooks and analyzing the long-term assumptions that drive our valuation models. The questions now are: What will be the final resolution of the tariff negotiations with both Canada and Mexico as well as China? Which products will be tariffed, and which may be excluded? How much will the tariffs be? How long will tariffs last? What retaliatory tariffs will be instituted in response? These details will have significant implications on corporate margins and stock valuations. As of Feb. 28, 2025, according to a composite of our valuations, the US stock market was trading at about a 1% discount to fair value. That was the first time since a year ago (when stocks pulled back following inflation data that led to a shift in interest-rate expectations) the market has traded at a discount to a composite of our fair values. We also continue to see an opportunity in small-cap stocks, which remain undervalued compared with the broad market on both an absolute and relative value basis. By style, we recommend that investors: View more Latest prices where available. We expect that Canadian oil producers would be significantly negatively affected as a 10% tariff makes overseas medium and heavy crude more attractive to US midcontinent and Gulf refiners. Examples of other Canadian products that could be hit include lumber and potash. Focus on the fundamentals amid the uncertainty of Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs. As such, we recommended that investors overweight value stocks and underweight growth stocks, as growth stocks were trading at the highest premium over fair value since the disruptive tech bubble in early 2021, yet value stocks were still undervalued. For the year to date through March 3, 2025, the Morningstar US Value Index was up 5.54%, whereas the Morningstar US Growth Index was down 3.81%. Mentioned: Costco Wholesale Corp (COST), Ford Motor Co (F), Meta Platforms Inc (META), General Motors Co (GM), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL), Procter & Gamble Co (PG), Constellation Brands Inc (STZ), Walmart Inc (WMT) One of the hardest aspects of investing is separating signal from noise. Divining between news that identifies a paradigm shift that will either positively or negatively affect earnings (signal) versus news that garners a lot of attention yet will not meaningfully impact a company\u2019s business (noise). Based on our valuations by market capitalization, we recommend that investors: Only two months into the year and it already feels like we have had a full year\u2019s worth of headlines. From earnings and guidance, to the DeepSeek scare, to President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariffs, volatility has risen anew. In such a volatile market in which economic policy can lead to such a quick change in valuations, portfolio positioning remains especially important. No matter how the tariffs may play out in the short term, we think investors should look to overweight those areas trading at a significant margins of safety below their long-term intrinsic values and underweight those areas that are overvalued. With growth stocks selling off and value stocks appreciating, we have seen our sector valuations consolidate toward fair value as overvalued sectors have become less overvalued, and undervalued sectors have become less so. For example, healthcare, real estate, and basic materials were some of the more undervalued sectors at the beginning of the year, but each has moved closer toward fair value. Among the overvalued sectors at the beginning of the year, consumer cyclical was the most overvalued and has since dropped to fair value. In the 2025 US Market Outlook, we highlighted that the US stock market was bumping up against the upper end of our fair value range and investors should temper their return expectations for this year. In fact, since the end of 2010, the market had traded at that much of a premium or higher less than 10% of the time. With the market trading at the high end of our fairly valued range, we noted that we had become progressively cautious and positioning is increasingly important. Considering how fluid the situation remains as to the threats of implementing tariffs, once we have specificity on the amount of tariffs that will be implemented and a base case as to how long those tariffs may last, we will adjust our projections and valuations accordingly. In our 2025 outlook, we had also stated that \u201cthe bigger wild card in the first quarter will be what President Donald Trump may or may not do regarding his assertions to implement new tariffs.\u201d That assertion is coming to fruition. Yet, for now, this may mostly be noise as it will be the final resolution of the tariff negotiations that will affect long-term valuations. \u00a9 2025 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved.

Economists have also lowered their GDP forecasts. In fact, Morgan Stanley economist Michael Gapen revised his economic outlook from \u201cslower growth, stickier inflation\u201d to a more pessimistic \u201cslower growth, firmer inflation.\u201d This change in outlook has led Gapen to lower his full-year GDP growth forecast from 1.9% to 1.5%. Commodities The S&P 500 (SPX) continues to slide as Wall Street experts increasingly warn about the potential for an economic downturn, with some even mentioning the possibility of stagflation. For context, stagflation is a scenario where economic growth falls, but inflation remains high and unemployment rates rise. Historically, the S&P 500 has performed poorly during stagflationary periods, with an annualized decline of 10%. Indices Overall, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\u00a0(SPY)\u00a0based on 415 Buys, 84 Holds, and six Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a\u00a013% rally in its share price\u00a0over the past year, the\u00a0average SPY price target\u00a0of $690.21 per share implies 23.1% upside potential. Stocks This worry has grown as investors try to understand the impact of Trump\u2019s continuously changing trade policies and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Indeed, the possibility of stagflation has increased recently, according to Evercore ISI\u2019s Julian Emanuel, who noted that tariff policies and Musk\u2019s DOGE efforts could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. However, he did note that there are no clear signs of stagflation yet.

GBP/USD trades in positive territory above 1.2900 on Tuesday. The pair advances as the US Dollar struggles to recover on growing concerns over the Trump administration's trade policy causing the US economy to tilt into recession. This means that the relentless mechanical selling pressure we\u2019ve seen is done and dusted\u2014at least for now. When CTAs go from forced liquidations to short positioning, it sets the stage for potential short-covering rallies, especially if any macro data or Fed rhetoric catches traders offside. This week\u2019s CPI report will be dissected to oblivion, but last month\u2019s inflation print won\u2019t reveal a thing about the potential price shock from incoming tariffs. Last Friday\u2019s jobs report? That didn\u2019t even fully capture the Doge-driven government layoffs, leaving the Fed to connect the dots and guess at the fallout. For those who assumed Donald Trump would cave at the first whiff of market distress, think again. The administration isn\u2019t just trimming fat\u2014it\u2019s taking a chainsaw to the Washington bureaucracy, slashing government payrolls, and sending a clear message to the Fed: Cut rates, or we\u2019ll make you. That said, the greenback didn\u2019t go down without a fight. As risk sentiment soured, it caught a safe-haven bid against major peers, with Treasury demand soaring once again. The takeaway? Without the U.S. consumer running in high gear, it\u2019s not just America that\u2019s in trouble\u2014the entire global economy could be in for a rough ride. But the real trade to watch right now is Japanese repatriation flows.

Meanwhile, the USDJPY short trade from yesterday has yet to fully deliver, as the move sub-147 has lacked conviction.

And if that wasn\u2019t enough, Bitcoin\u2014Wall Street\u2019s favourite high-beta risk barometer\u2014took a nosedive, adding fuel to the risk-off inferno. This isn\u2019t just a garden-variety pullback. This is a market scrambling for answers and coming up empty.

How long this phase of investor carnage drags on hinges entirely on who flinches first\u2014the Fed shifting to rate cuts or Washington easing off tariffs and the cost-cutting brakes. But instead of the long-awaited Trump Tax & Deregulation 2.0 playbook, markets are being force-fed what U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dubs a \"detox\" period\u2014code for a brutal government spending withdrawal.

If the Fed blinks first, this could be the mother of all buy-the-dip opportunities\u2014but if the White House miscalculates, risk assets could be staring down a recession freight train with no brakes. Buckle up. SPI Asset Management provides forex, commodities, and global indices analysis, in a timely and accurate fashion on major economic trends, technical analysis, and worldwide events that impact different asset classes and investors. For weeks, Wall Street options traders have been buzzing about whether Doge\u2019s chainsaw approach to slashing government largesse was more than just tough talk\u2014whether the stock market was being set up as the sacrificial lamb to force the Fed\u2019s hand into aggressive rate cuts aimed at helping Main Street at Wall Street\u2019s expense. The grand experiment? Engineering an economic slowdown that stops short of a full-blown recession. Well, the theory is rapidly becoming a reality, and markets are now scrambling to price in just how much pain Washington is willing to inflict before policymakers blink. The U.S. dollar slid against the yen on Monday as investors braced for a potential U.S. economic slowdown and a relentless Wall Street selloff, both fueled by policy uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s economic agenda at home and abroad. The weight of tariff fears, aggressive government cost-cutting, and Federal Reserve inaction has traders questioning just how much economic turbulence Washington is willing to endure before stepping in. The fear factor is creeping in. With supply chains scrambling, corporate America second-guessing hiring plans, and consumers staring down potential tariff-induced price hikes, investors wonder:\u00a0is this a controlled slowdown or the start of a runaway train?

The culprit? Mounting concerns that Trump\u2019s economic shake-up could knock the US growth engine off its axis, triggering a recession, hence the widespread risk-off move. Complacency is a sucker\u2019s bet. When volatility smoulders like this, it only takes one spark to set the whole thing ablaze. The stock market is badly rattled to kick off the week, staring down a high-stakes question: Is this a controlled economic slowdown, or are we careening toward a runaway recession? The rout was swift and brutal\u2014all three major indices opened deep in the red, and while there was a fleeting afternoon bounce, the selloff proved relentless into the close. Investors are waking up to the reality that a policy-induced slowdown might not be a bug\u2014it could be the feature. With government layoffs, tariffs, and tightening financial conditions all converging, traders are left asking:\u00a0just how much pain will Washington tolerate before blinking? Volatility is back with a vengeance, and this time, it\u2019s got Trump\u2019s trade war and fiscal chainsaw economics fueling the fire. Markets are on edge as the administration\u2019s scorched-earth approach to government spending collides with protectionist uncertainty, creating a perfect storm of policy-induced turbulence. Markets are itching for clarity, but Powell & Co. are sticking to their waiting game.

The pair advances as the US Dollar struggles to recover on growing concerns over the Trump administration's trade policy causing the US economy to tilt into recession. Kathleen BrooksXTB UK President Trump\u2019s economic policies have been compared to Liz Truss\u2019s in recent days. However, while the shock and awe approach to economic policy is similar, the impact is different. Trump\u2019s policies are hitting stocks hard and weighing on domestic equity market valuations, in contrast Liz Truss\u2019s policies decimated the UK bond market. Treasuries are rising on the back of President Trump\u2019s economic policies and yields are falling. The market is looking through the risk of a US recession exacerbating the huge budget deficit, for now. However, if economic data does start to deteriorate sharply, then we could see Treasuries also come under pressure. CFD\u2019s, Options and Forex are leveraged products which can result in losses that exceed your initial deposit. These products may not be suitable for all investors and you should seek independent advice if necessary. Tech rebound stumbles EUR/USD trades at fresh multi-month highs above 1.0900 in the American session on Tuesday. The Euro benefits from news that Germany's Greens are predicting a spending deal this week. Meanwhile, the US Dollar stays under pressure amid growing recession fears. Hopes for a broad-based market recovery on Tuesday have been dashed. US markets had a mixed open, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones faltered when markets opened, while the Nasdaq initially rallied, led by some tech stocks including Tesla, Netflix and Meta. However, news that President Trump has slapped a further 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from Canada has sapped market confidence. Tariffs on these imports are now at 50% and are seemingly in retaliation for Ontario\u2019s decision to impose a 25% tariff on electricity exports to the US.

There are few positive factors driving the S&P 500 right now, and downside momentum has taken hold. All sectors of the S&P 500 are lower, which suggests that this sell off is indiscriminate and based on fear. A benign CPI report on Wednesday could go some way to boosting sentiment, if it increases expectations of Fed rate cuts.\u00a0 However, a stock market recovery may only be possible if Donald Trump backtracks on some of his most damaging economic policies, the question is, can the stock market force him to do this?

This is triggering a rush to safe havens. The gold price is up nearly $25 an ounce on Tuesday, and it is comfortably above $2,900. Breaching the $3,000 level for the yellow metal seems like only a matter of time. The dollar has failed to attract safe haven bids, and although it is off its lows, the dollar index remains weak. EUR/USD is above $1.0900, but it has backed away from the $1.0930 high so far on Tuesday. Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. The crypto market continued its ongoing downleg as the week started, as its market cap capitalization reached a low of $2.44 trillion on Tuesday, levels not seen since early November. Can Wednesday\u2019s CPI report boost sentiment? European stocks are also seeing the sell off accelerate as we progress through the afternoon. The FTSE 100 is the best performer, but it is still lower by more than 1%.\u00a0 Stocks are a sentiment driven market. Interestingly, the sell off in stocks is broad based, for example, the market capitalization weighted S&P 500 is falling alongside the equal weighted S&P 500, which suggests that value stocks are also out of favour. This is a sentiment driven market that is based on the economic policies of one man: Donald Trump. If he leaves the US Business Roundtable without at least some words of comfort, then the sell off could get uglier later today. The only hope for a recovery in the short term is the outcome of President Trump\u2019s round table with top US CEOs, which is scheduled for later today. The market will want to see 1, some rolling back of tariff threats and 2, potentially some support for equity markets. We think that both are unlikely, which may spook markets further. US equities have turned lower once again and hopes of a recovery in the tech sector have been dashed. Tesla jumped by 5% at the open on Tuesday, reversing about a third of Monday\u2019s decline. That has now withered away to approx. 1%, as Trump\u2019s tariffs weigh heavily on tech. As we have said before, the tech trade, and the AI trade in particular, is reliant on stable economic policy and good global trade relations to thrive. These pillars have been knocked over by the Trump regime, and tech bulls are paying the price. \u00a92025 \"FXStreet\" All Rights Reserved Is this Trump\u2019s Liz Truss moment?

Back in November, the focus was on the positive impact from Trump\u2019s economic policies, however, now they are reality his policies are negative for growth, at least in the short to medium term. Trump\u2019s erratic and reactionary trade policy is eroding faith in US exceptionalism and fueling recession fears. There is now a 25% chance of a US recession this quarter, according to Bloomberg\u2019s recession monitor, not long ago that threat was negligible. \u00a0\u00a0The more tariffs that Trump imposes, and the longer they are in place, then the higher recession odds will become. This is a disaster for US stock markets. Gold reverses its direction following Monday's decline and trades above $2,910 on Tuesday.

Riley Wealth, said the narrative from the White House \u201cchanges on a daily basis. The markets are nervous, Canada is on edge, and Trump\u2019s pain tolerance may yet define the economic and political landscape of 2025. Twenty months remain until the midterms \u2013 a stretch that might feel like an eternity. And somewhere in a battleground state, someone might already be counting every second. Andrew Saunders, President and CEO Trump\u2019s obsession with the ups and downs of markets was expected to act as a de facto system of checks and balances on the President\u2019s impulses. But increasingly, not everyone is of the view that he\u2019s as fussed as we might think. Jason Daw, head of North American rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told David Berman that it would take a bear market that spans many weeks. The letter T: Loblaw Cos. has created a new symbol \u2013 a \u201cT\u201d inside a black triangle \u2013 that it is preparing to tack on to the shelf prices in its stores to denote products affected by tariffs. Many vendors and suppliers now find themselves in limbo, with overdue payments from Hudson\u2019s Bay that they worry could be at least partially wiped out during the retailer\u2019s restructuring process, Susan Krashinsky Robertson reports. (Ed Yardeni, a noted bull, wrote to clients on Sunday that his firm \u201ccan\u2019t rule out the possibility that a bear market started on Feb. 20.\u201d) The loonie has weakened against the U.S. dollar, as investors brace for the Bank of Canada\u2019s tough decision on interest rates tomorrow. The central bank is expected to cut by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent, but it\u2019s caught between a rock and a hard place: Reducing the cost of borrowing might help support an economy rattled by U.S. tariffs, but it could also further weaken the loonie and stoke inflation. Keeping rates steady risks stalling economic growth amid rising market uncertainty. Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.3 per cent in morning trading. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 declined 0.18 per cent, Germany\u2019s DAX rose 0.27 per cent and France\u2019s CAC 40 gained 0.14 per cent. Tesla, once electrified by Elon Musk\u2019s proximity to the President, has tumbled more than 50 per cent from its post-election high. Even Bitcoin, which seemed unstoppable last year, dropped below US$80,000 yesterday from more than US$106,000 in December. The U.S. Treasury market, where investors traditionally seek safety, is signalling unease as bond yields continue to slide. As market turbulence continues, Trump is still issuing heavy threats against Canada. This week, 25-per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are set to go into effect on March 12, but the broader universal tariff is looming largest. Originally pegged for inauguration day, the sweeping tariff has been repeatedly delayed and is now scheduled to take effect on April 2. In Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed 0.64 per cent lower, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was little changed. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. The loonie and the long game Speaking up: A key Canadian cardinal is taking aim at Trump\u2019s foreign aid cuts. Report a technical issue For Wall Street, getting a clear read on Trump\u2019s mindset has proven elusive. Investors have endured white-knuckle weeks of market whiplash, with the S&P 500 dropping more than 2 per cent on Monday and the Nasdaq sliding nearly 4 per cent. In the past eight days alone, major U.S. indexes have swung more than 1 per cent up or down seven times. That\u2019s not normal. On the bookshelves: Long a symbol of cross-border friendship, a library split between Quebec and Vermont is being thrust into a geopolitical fray. Editorial code of conduct \u201cThere had been a sense that President Trump kind of measured his success on stock market performance,\u201d Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, said in a research note to clients. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Compensation: Pressure is mounting on the Law Society of Ontario to release a confidential report into how its recently ousted CEO received a more than 50-per-cent salary increase \u2013 bringing her pay to nearly $1-million \u2013 without the knowledge of the regulator\u2019s board. Trump\u2019s readiness to create economic turbulence to achieve his policy goals is unsettling for a market accustomed to a President who closely links his success to stock market performance. While market health has never been a reliable indicator of the broader economy\u2019s well-being \u2013 rising Nvidia shares, for instance, don\u2019t necessarily mean the middle class is thriving \u2013 it was, at the very least, a predictable element of his presidency. In a political landscape where so much felt uncertain, that predictability was oddly reassuring. Oil prices are slipping, and Canadian government bond yields are following U.S. Treasuries lower. The Liberal Party has put its hopes in former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney to counter Trump\u2019s unpredictability \u2013 an issue set to dominate a federal election that has suddenly looked too close to call.

Presidents from Jimmy Carter to George H.W. Bush, who saw their political fortunes dashed by economic turmoil, might have advised the current administration to take note. From Canada\u2019s perspective, Tim Shufelt recently wrote, diplomacy has proven pointless in making the case that the pretexts for tariffs are bogus. A faltering U.S. stock market would be about as powerful an ally as the country could ask for. Good morning. Wall Street is losing faith that market turmoil will rein in Donald Trump, as investors reckon with a president who sees financial pain as part of the process. With forecasts dimming and corporate warnings mounting, concerns over tariff-driven fallout are deepening. Trade: The U.S. Energy Secretary said the White House might remove its tariffs on Canadian oil and gas. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that Trump is also considering tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber industries, describing Canada\u2019s 250-per-cent tariffs on U.S. dairy as \u201coutrageous.\u201d He has not explained that U.S. exporters are not even reaching the halfway point of the amount of dairy they can ship to Canada without incurring taxes. \u00a9 Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc. All rights reserved. U.S. consumer confidence has also fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, according to the latest data from the Conference Board. This signals that consumers \u2013 whose spending powers 70 per cent of the economy \u2013 are feeling the pressure as uncertainty mounts. Someone, somewhere in the Republican Party might be reassessing their tolerance for pain. The midterms might be months away, but market volatility, rising prices and potential voter unrest could make those days difficult to bear unless President Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line strategies soon yield the results he promised on the campaign trail. The fallout from Trump\u2019s threats and the market gyrations is rippling through the Canadian economy, where tariffs would dampen already weak business investment, raise prices, freeze spending and slow the real estate market just as it had begun to pick up.", "https://www.aol.com/delta-stock-falls-company-cuts-220553493.html": "Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The company's warnings serve as one of the earliest reads on how recent volatility in markets and worries over the economic outlook are weighing on corporate performance in the first quarter of the year. Given the market's recent drawdown amid weakening confidence from the consumer, investors have been closely watching for connections between a souring consumer and the outlook for American corporates. Delta stock fell 10% in premarket trading on Tuesday, after dropping as much as 13% following the news. Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks For premium support please call: Delta Air Lines (DAL) cut its outlook for the current quarter on Monday, citing a dip in consumer and corporate confidence as well as softening domestic demand amid \"macro uncertainty.\" Shares of Delta were down more than 16% before Monday's news amid a difficult year for the industry. The deadliest crash in the US in 16 years took place in January and then another crash in Toronto in February saw 21 passengers injured but no fatalities. The company's comments about deteriorating sentiment among American consumers also come after stocks plunged on Monday due in part to increasingly cautious views about the US economy. In recent months, consumer sentiment data has tumbled and spending data has also begun to track lower. In January, consumer spending fell for the first time in nearly two years, and separate data showed retail sales saw the largest monthly decline in a year. Notably, Delta highlighted that softness in domestic demand led to the lower guidance, while \"premium, international and loyalty revenue growth trends are consistent with expectations.\" Meanwhile, consumer confidence saw its largest monthly decline in nearly four years during the month of February. Uncertainty about the impact of President Trump's policies has been key in driving the weakening consumer mood. This update also fits another key market narrative, where US growth forecasts have been sliding while similar outlooks in Europe have been rising.", "https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/stocks-to-trade-raja-venkatraman-stock-recommendations-three-stocks-to-buy-today-11-march-sensex-nifty-11741605500057.html": " The emerging trend suggests that the rally seen last week was a relief rally that retraced one-third of the fall seen since February highs.

Hence, from a trading perspective, we can note that on the hourly charts, the gap area around 22800, combined with the 38.2% Fibonacci resistance trendline, has curtailed the prices. The sharp rally that we witnessed last week is now facing challenges to stage a further up move.The emerging trend suggests that the rally seen last week was a relief rally that retraced one-third of the fall seen since February highs. Hence, one should track the trends that are in progress, as the upmove needs to continue above 22800 to reinstate the bullish bias. Momentums on hourly charts indicate that the prices, after settling down, seem to have witnessed a resumption of selling pressure.

The selloff was attributed to weak cues from global markets, including a significant decline in US stock futures, concerns over trade tensions, and upcoming economic indicators like inflation data from the US and India.

The US is a huge market, it\u2019s very hard to avoid and you probably wouldn\u2019t want to.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s up to each fund to stay ahead of the trends \u2014 who could benefit potentially and who\u2019s probably a little more exposed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes back to that long-term thinking. But typically if there\u2019s no exposure to the US you\u2019d be seeing a worse outcome.\u201d Graham Cooke, head of consumer research at comparison website Finder, said Aussies who were worried could consider moving their super into a lower-risk profile. The Australian share market followed Wall Street deep into the red, with more than $49 billion wiped of the ASX 200 in early trading on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s usually just a case of a couple of clicks within your super account,\u201d he said. Pension returns tracked accumulation return trends. The median balanced pension option fell by an estimated 0.9 per cent, the median growth pension option by 1.4 per cent, while the median capital stable pension option was up 0.1 per cent. \u201cIncreasingly as super funds get bigger we are exposed to more international markets, there\u2019s really no way to avoid it,\u201d he said. Australians\u2019 superannuation balances have been hammered by turmoil in US share markets as Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war escalates and recession fears grow. Australia\u2019s biggest superannuation fund has been fined $27m for charging duplicate fees to tens of thousands of customers. \u201cYou can say I want 50 per cent in medium risk, 25 per cent in high risk and 25 per cent in low risk. You can decide to weight your super as per your appetite. The only issue with that is if the market does start to recover, then you\u2019ll recover slower.\u201d Mr Rappell said exposure to Wall Street turmoil was unavoidable. \u201cThe level of ups and downs we\u2019ve been seeing for a while has actually been very low, so this is probably going to back to the longer-term trend where we do see a bit of movement. It gets back to where people\u2019s focus needs to be in superannuation \u2014 don\u2019t focus on the day-to-day, month-to-month but get long-term settings right and drown out the noise.\u201d Aussies\u2019 superannuation balances have been hammered by the turmoil in US share markets as fears of a Trump recession grow. Despite the Reserve Bank cutting the cash rate for the first time since November 2020, Australian and international share markets \u2014 key drivers of super fund returns \u2014 declined in February as Mr Trump\u2019s tariff agenda came into focus. Nearly half of Australia\u2019s $4.2 trillion superannuation pool is invested in international assets, with the US stock market making up a significant chunk. \u201cLook, we\u2019re going to have disruption, but we\u2019re OK with that,\u201d the President said, stressing that \u201cyou can\u2019t really watch the stock market\u201d \u2014 which has now seen all of its post-election gains wiped out. Australians are set to work longer as rising cost-of-living sees them put off their retirement. Total superannuation assets rose 11.5 per cent over the year to reach $4.2 trillion as of December 31, according to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). frank.chung@news.com.au \u201cIt will be fine long-term,\u201d Mr Musk insisted on X. Total contributions increased by 14.8 per cent to $198.1 billion. Of this, employer contributions increased 10.8 per cent to $144 billion while member contributions rose 26.7 per cent to $54.1 billion. With March off to a rocky start and warnings of worse to come, Aussies should brace themselves but learn to \u201cdrown out the noise\u201d, according to Mr Rappell. Benefit payments increased by 12 per cent to $124.4 billion, with lump sum payments rising by 7.8 per cent to $68.2 billion and pension payments increasing by 17.5 per cent to $56.2 billion. The Nasdaq Composite index posted its worst day since September 2022 on Monday and shares in Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla lost an eye-watering 15 per cent, while other big tech stocks including Apple and Nvidia were also hammered. \u201cThe key message is be alert, don\u2019t be alarmed,\u201d said Kirby Rappell, executive director of SuperRatings. \u201cFor anyone coming to the age of retirement now I think it would definitely be a concern,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d be looking for Trump to reverse course.\u201d \u201cI think this is probably the first time we\u2019ve seen volatility re-emerge for a while and so no doubt people will be noticing that,\u201d he said. He added the key would be how funds managed US exposure. \u201cThe impact of tariffs on China and potential flow-on effects to the Australian economy in particular influenced Australian share expectations, offsetting any potential benefit from the reduction in interest rates,\u201d SuperRatings said. While returns fell in February, funds have delivered a roughly 7 per cent return so far this financial year, and Mr Rappell said provided they can \u201cnavigate the next few months well\u201d, members are on track for a positive full-year outcome. Our Apps NAB\u2019s Super Insights Report 2023 found total offshore allocation of investment portfolios was at 47.8 per cent, led by large funds the majority of which said they intended to increase their international share over the next two years. Australian mortgage holders could be saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in continuing debt if they make one choice every homeowner is faced with. Wall Street plunged again on Monday after Mr Trump, in an interview on Fox News on Sunday, refused to rule out the possibility that his tariff policies could tip the US economy into recession and spark inflation. Mr Cooke said the global economic turmoil was \u201cdefinitely reason to be concerned\u201d, noting that many Australians who retired around the time of the GFC felt the hit. Data released by superannuation research house on Monday showed monthly returns turned negative for the month of February, the second monthly negative return for the financial year. John Bennett, NAB executive for markets corporate and institutional sales, said at the time that the findings highlighted \u201ccontinued internationalisation of investment portfolios and the ongoing challenge for large funds in deploying incoming capital to the domestic market without amplifying concentration risk\u201d. SuperRatings estimates that the median balanced option fell by 0.8 per cent in February, while the median growth option fell by 1.2 per cent. The median capital stable option delivered a small but positive 0.1 per cent return.", "https://www.etfdailynews.com/2025/03/11/nuscale-power-nysesmr-stock-price-down-1-7-on-analyst-downgrade/": " Posted by MarketBeat News on Mar 11th, 2025 A number of hedge funds have recently added to or reduced their stakes in the stock.
